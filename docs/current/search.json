    "text": "Most up to date version at https://howisonlab.github.io/open_source_software_course/current/\nWelcome to the materials for a course on open source software development, taught at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. The course is taught by James Howison, with contributions from a set of wonderful TAs, including Chongyan Chen.\nThe course was developed as an undergraduate version of a course on Peer Production: Open Source, Wikipedia, and Beyond.\nI call this a “socio-technical course” because I interleave social theory about open source (such as theories of motivation, approaches to governance, sources of lack of diversity) in among the technical skills needed to participate in open source projects (git and github commands, markdown, unit testing, packaging). This interleaving is inspired equally by Karl Fogel’s approach in Producing Open Source Software, and the intellectual traditions of Sociotechnical Systems, Sociomateriality, and the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems (CSST).\nIn these materials I present these in two separate sequences: “insights” and “skills”. When I teach, though, I interleave them in what I hope are synergistic ways. For example, when teaching about coordination theory, the week includes the git and github approaches to managing dependencies (such as identifying and resolving conflicts, as well as branching). I pair literature on knowledge sharing up with skills to do it, such as understanding Markdown and referring to Issues/Commits. You can see this interleaving in the most recent syllabus at Section 2.1.\nThe course begins with a two-part physical in-class exercise: students fold paper planes, and share improvements. The first exercise addresses how patents and copyright affect sharing, building on each others work, and the division of claims. The second takes a more technical tack, and addresses management of versions and conflicts. These exercises give a physical analog for the topics in the course, giving a grounding for discussing intellectual concepts and git commands.",

Students should email the professor prior to class if they cannot make it. Material throughout the course builds on earlier material (both technical and conceptual). If you cannot make class you should refer to the online materials first and then consult with your classmates. Office hours are not for personal replays of teaching, nor can they compensate for not participating in discussion.\nHints on participation:\n\nUseful participation can come from asking questions if you don’t understand the point someone is making. If you have questions, very likely others do to.\nYou can also summarize discussion which helps everyone by giving them something to test their understanding of the discussion.\nYou can challenge or disagree with people, sometimes that can be introducing a counter-example or questioning whether evidence really means what the speaker originally thought.\nI really welcome examples from your own experience. For example if there is an organization, movement, or line of thought (modern/traditional) in your culture that relates to open source development, I would love that to be part of the discussion.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Weekly Homework Challenges\nThe course will have assignments based on bth insight and skills topics we are learning (with some leaning towards skills), including use of the DataCamp course (see below).\n\n\n3.2.3 Papers and Projects\n\n3.2.3.1 Analogies paper\nHow would you explain what we have been learning about git to your future work teammates?\nIn this assignment you will describe three different analogies for git-based collaboration (including branching, GitHub, and PRs). No more than two analogies can be found online (use references!), at least one you must create yourself. Each analogy should cover as much of git and GitHub collaboration as possible.\nFor each, include both text and pictures. You should have approximately 2 pages per analogy (~500-750 words). Pictures can be photos you find online, or diagrams you create yourself (digital collage can be useful). You should include connections between your analogy and the specific git and GitHub commands we have learned (e.g., init, add, commit, push, pull, create PR, merge, etc.). In particular, you must include a discussion of “splitting a pull request” including git cherry-pick. Your analogies should cover multiple commands (not a one analogy for one command); each should cover as much of git and GitHub collaboration as possible.\nIn a final 1-2 pages of writing (~350-750 words), Compare and contrast your three analogies in reference to this question: How would each analogy help your teammates? What might it make clear, what might it hide or obfuscate? How might using a combination of your analogies help? Could that combination make things more difficult?\nYour paper must be submitted as a PR (will be taught in the course).\nInclude a note at the top of the file telling me which formal citation approach you are using (e.g., APA, MLA, etc). Students are cautioned that as a scholarly paper proper citation and use of sources is required otherwise students will face academic misconduct proceedings. See UTexas materials on Academic Integrity at https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php\nGenAI: For this assignment, I give you specific permission to use GenAI systems like ChatGPT. The requirement, however, is that you must include the sequence of prompts you used, your analysis of the analogy provided by the system, discuss how you adapted the analogy for presentation in the paper, and how you added images/diagrams (as well as including this analogy in your compare and contrast).\nThe structure of the paper should be as follows (a page is ~300-500 words):\n# Introduction (~ 1-2 paragraphs/100-200 words)\n\n# Analogy 1 (~1 page including images/~500 words)\n\n# Analogy 2 (~1 page including images/~500 words)\n\n# Analogy 3 (~1 page including images/~500 words)\n\n# Compare and Contrast Analogies (1-2 pages of writing, ~350-750 words).\n\n# References (excluded from any word counts).\n\n\n3.2.3.2 Final Paper or project\nPick one of the following two options:\n\nConduct a trace data analysis that compares at least 3 projects contained in this provided dataset:\n\nhttps://github.com/howisonlab/transition_augur/raw/main/oss_data.zip\nThe code used to pull these data is here: https://github.com/howisonlab/transition_augur\nThe ER diagram for the underlying data is linked in the notebook in that repo.\nThese are open source projects funded by the US National Science Foundation during the last decade in a program called SI2. The data is collected from GitHub using the augur project from Linux Foundation. The files when unzipped are quite large, commits.csv has over 4.5million rows. You will not be able to work with these files in Excel (for example) but they should work ok with tools like Tableau or Pandas/Matplotlib.\nYour analysis should use the trace data collected to address insight concepts that we have discussed during the course, for example: Leadership, Coordination, Motivation, Dependency (including interdependency), Governance, Bias and lack of diversity. You should provide figures (most likely multiple time-series analyses) and you must relate your work to either a discussion in the book http://producingoss.com/ or a trace data analysis of open source data you find in the peer reviewed literature. One suggested source is the the Mining Software Repositories conference: http://www.msrconf.org/ Your project document should include multiple figures and ~300-500 words of writing. Think the equivalent of about 3 pages.\n\nWrite a 1,000-1,500 word scholarly comparative analysis of 3 open source projects that connect with your interests. Explain why you chose these three projects to compare. You should include in your discussion topics such as: leadership, collaboration, license choice, ownership, contribution process, how the project seeks to attract contributions, how the project uses collaboration infrastructure. You must include screenshots and you must discuss at least one PR for each project (of course you can discuss more). You should reference literature from the course and connect with the discussion in at least two additional peer reviewed articles. You may find these two review articles a useful place to identify relevant literature: https://doi.org/10.1145/2089125.2089127 or https://www.misqresearchcurations.org/blog/2021/12/7/information-systems-development\n\nSubmission:\nSubmit by making a PR. Note that it should be a separate PR from other assignment submissions; this means you must use a different branch name for this work.\nInclude a note at the top of the file telling me which formal citation approach you are using (e.g., APA, MLA, etc). Students are cautioned that as a scholarly paper proper citation and use of sources is required otherwise students will face academic misconduct proceedings. See “Academic Integrity” presentation if at all unsure.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Late submission policy\nThe late policy for papers/projects/presentation is a 10% reduction (minimum one point) for submissions up to 24 hours after the due time, but zero points after that. If assignment answers are discussed in class, submissions will not be accepted after. You can, of course, contact me if you have an emergency.",

You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.\nIf you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html\n\n\n5.7.4 The Sanger Learning Center\nAll students, including graduate students, are welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit https://ugs.utexas.edu/slc/grad or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).\n\n\n5.7.5 University Writing Center free programs for grad students\n\n\n5.7.6 Libraries\n\n\n5.7.7 IT services\n\n\n5.7.8 Student Emergency Services\n\n\n5.7.9 Important Safety Information\nIf you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call BCAL (the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something doesn’t feel right—it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.\nThe following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/\nOccupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.\nStudents requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.\nIn the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.\nLink to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at: http://www.utexas.edu/emergency",

    "text": "3.1 Exercise 1: Paper Planes and Innovation\nThis exercise is part one of two.\nBoth have students folding paper planes as an analogy for (potentially) collaborative work.\nThis first exercise focuses on collaborative innovation. It is designed to make concrete the idea of sharing work and building on the designs of others. Designs are expressed as both artifacts (planes) and source code (instructions). It gradually introduces the role that intellectual property can play (patents and copyright) and thus motivates open source licences.\nThe second exercise focuses on version control. It is designed to make concrete the basics of git repositories and collaboration. The exercise introduces the idea of working spaces and repositories. The work continues to be making changes to paper planes, and different versions are placed on trays to be stored (as numbered versions) in the repository. We progress from individual work in the repository, to more than one person contributing to the repository. That enables us to introduce the idea of synchronizing with a shared repository. Currently the exercises ends with identifying and resolving a conflict.\nMaterials needed:",

    "title": "4  Introduction: What is open source?",
    "section": "4.4 Why open source?",
    "text": "4.4 Why open source?\n\n4.4.1 For the right to repair\nThe readings focused on this, highlighting current challenges in repair. You read about farmers who purchase John Deere farm equipment. Many want to be able to work on their equipment on their own, right on the farm. This is both because they are at a great distance from dealers, the equipment is expensive to transport, and they have paid a lot for the equipment and object to paying more to keep it working.\nIn many ways this is the same situation that Richard Stallman (founder of the Free Software Foundation) faced when dealing with the printer in his office. This is one of the foundational stories of the free software movement.\nHave you faced issues in trying to repair something? What prevented you?\nDiscussion: what is needed to repair a blender? A car? A list sorting algorithm? A web-page?\nWhat role does source code play? What else is needed?\n\n\n4.4.2 To avoid “proprietary lock in”\nThe popularity of open source can be understand as a kind of software escrow. Producers of tools want their users to rely on the tool, but if the code is hidden then a user is taking on a significant risk. That is is that the software stops getting updated because the company disappears. This means that maintenance stops, which means that the code suffers “bit rot” or “code collapse”.\n“Code collapse” occurs when software is not maintained. Not only do new features not appear, but security holes can be discovered which cannot be fixed. More subtly the code gets out of sync with its ecosystem, so that the way it talks to other software might stop working as other software is updated. If something changes in the software requirements (e.g., a change in the tax code) then the software cannot be updated.\nSo the buyer of proprietary software want an assurance that the software will continue to be updated, but no firm can assure its customers that it will be around for ever. To solve this purchasers used an approach called “Software Escrow”. Escrow means using a 3rd party (not the firm buying the software and not the firm building the software) to keep a copy of the software delivered. That escrow agent keeps that code secret unless specific events occurs, such as the software producer going out of business or discontinuing the product. In those cases the firm buying the code gets the source (and a license to use it). Escrow is a sort of insurance policy to help make relying on other people less risky.\nOpen source shares some of these characteristics. When building on someone else’s code, knowing it is open source means that the user can be sure they can taken over maintenance, even if the original developers stop working on the project.\n\n\n4.4.3 Shared maintenance of infrastructure\nWhen organizations compete with each other they want you to purchase their product, and not the product of their competitor. To purchase “Extra” brand chewing gum, and not “Trident” brand.\nYet much of the effort that goes into producing a product is spent on things that are not directly related to the product they are selling. Think of things like the supply of office furniture, the repainting of lines in the parking lot. These sort of efforts are known as “infrastructure”.\nIn many cases infrastructure is purchased from other companies, known as “contracting” or “out-sourcing”. The general logic is that companies that specialize in office furniture will do a better and cheaper job than if the chewing gum company was to make (or even buy) its own furniture. For example, Economics of scale mean that the outsourced furniture company can get bulk purchase discounts and pass them on to customers. They can also have full time people focused on monitoring safety issues with furniture and be responsible for fixing or replacing chairs that might injure people, saving the chewing gum company from lawsuits for dangerous chairs.\nMany users of open source are using open source software in the same way. For example IBM had a product called “WebSphere” which they sold to firms to run their “intranet” (internal corporate network publishing information or managing business processes). IBM originally wrote and maintained their own web server (as well as the application software that ran on top of it). Eventually, though, they changed to using the open source web server called Apache httpd. They argued that this saved them a lot of time maintaining their own infrastructure internally.\nIBM even started contributing changes that it needed or were helpful to their product back to httpd. They could have kept those changes secret, but then they would just have more infrastructure to maintain. Instead, they reasoned, they would contribute those changes back to httpd, effectively giving that work to their competitors (and everyone), but in return they received a lot more eyeballs on that code, ensuring that it was better tested and kept in sync.\nThey shared the cost of maintenance on the infrastructure to concentrate effort on their “secret sauce” of the WebSphere application layer, which was the thing that customers were really buying from them.\n\n\n4.4.4 The smartest people don’t work for you\nEach firm competes to hire great people. Yet it is unreasonable to think that you will have all the best people in the world working at your organization. For this reason firms seek to access outside intelligence. Sometimes this is possible through outsourcing, but other times problems are quite specific and require engagement with information or requirements that are quite specific to the business.\nBill Joy (from Sun Microsystems)is credited with the saying,\n\n“no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else,\n\nFirms therefore wna to access those smart people. Various approachs help, including “Crowdsourcing,” “innovation contests,” and “thought leadership” (publishing white papers and blogs that are discussed in public and then watching the discussion).\nOpen source projects are another place where expert outsiders can be found and engaged on topics of importance to firms.",

Almost all software has a foundation of open source, and open source tools successfully compete with proprietary software.\nThat success is unexpected. Why “give it away”, why “work for free”?\nOpen source (and Free Software) are politically engaged, holding the belief that they can changed the world through openness and freedom. Those building openly find this an emancipatory experience that they want to share with others (see Dunbar-Hestor’s “Hacking Diversity” book)\nOpen source is the leading edge of distributed work. Open source is done online, with participants that often don’t know each other and are all around the world.

    "text": "5.2 How to ask questions people want to answer\nMuch of this material is based on How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, Eric Raymond and Rick Moen with the addition of academic references and frameworks.\nOpen source projects are famous for having direct access to very knowledgeable people about the source code. Unlike when you purchase software, you can very likely get questions in front of some of the people that wrote the underlying code.\nBut ask yourself why they are there, reading and answering user questions. What drives them, what motivates them?\n\n5.2.1 RTFM\nThere is always a risk that a poorly asked question will be met with this response:\n\n\n\nRTFM Mug by Gubatron (CC-licensed http://www.flickr.com/photos/gubatron/3102412751)\n\n\nRTFM means to “Read the F***ing Manual” (which I’ll read as Read the Fine Manual). This rather unfriendly, and indeed unwelcoming response can occur when a question is asked in a way that doesn’t understand what it is that motivates people to participate in online support forums for software.\n\nI note that open communities are not necessarily welcoming places. In fact they can be quite aggressive, even toxic. It is perhaps not unrelated that open communities are also no diverse. We will discuss this later in the course when we consider Bias and Lack of Diversity in @bias-and-lack-of-diversity\n\nLakhani and von Hippel (2003) studied the Apache httpd mailing list. They mailed a survey link to participants the first time they saw them post to the list, only mailing each person once. They received responses from 28.9% of info providers, and 16.6% info seekers.\nThey report that :\n\nspending time in the forum had excellent ROI (return on investment) for information seekers (Seekers saved 9 minutes for every 1 minute spent writing questions).\nProviders answer questions that are easy for them, rarely do they seek out additional information to help answer.\nInformation Providers invest a lot of time in the forum, average of 80 hours a year.\nKey motivations to answer were reciprocity and reputation within Apache (not career prospects)\nBut information providers are primarily there to learn (&gt;90% of time spent reading, not answering).\n\nSo, very knowledgeable people answer people’s questions when it is easy for them to do so (not spending time preparing and researching, this is not Q&A for $$$ like Quora). So what is it that brings them to these forums (thus making it quick and easy for them to answer): learning.\nHuh? What do already knowledgeable people learn by hanging out watching less knowledgeable people ask questions?\nExercise\n\nWhat does someone learn from reading questions (and answers) in a technical forum?\nWhat does someone learn from answering?\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Engaging intellectual curiosity\n\nExperts love interesting problems and the solving of them.\nInteresting problems are those that reveal some new insights\nUninteresting problems are either obvious or unsolvable (poorly specified or not actionable).\nAsk questions like an intellectual partner.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Steps to answered question\nAgain, this is derived from How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, Eric Raymond and Rick Moen\n\nChoose the right venue\nDo (and show) your homework\nConvey your situation\nAsk an actionable question\nEngage the interest of your audience\nFollow up showing that you tried their suggestions. Don’t be the “Ok, fixed it now” guy\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/979:_Wisdom_of_the_Ancients\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Examples\n\n5.2.4.1 J Random Hacker\nDirectly from (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#examples)[http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#examples]\n\nStupid: I’m having problems with my motherboard. Can anybody help?\n\n\nJ. Random Hacker’s response to this is likely to be “Right. Do you need burping and diapering, too?” followed by a punch of the delete key.\n\n\nSmart: I tried X, Y, and Z on the S2464 motherboard. When that didn’t work, I tried A, B, and C. Note the curious symptom when I tried C. Obviously the florbish is grommicking, but the results aren’t what one might expect. What are the usual causes of grommicking on Athlon MP motherboards? Anybody got ideas for more tests I can run to pin down the problem?\n\n\nThis person, on the other hand, seems worthy of an answer. He/she has exhibited problem-solving intelligence rather than passively waiting for an answer to drop from on high.\n\n\nIn the last question, notice the subtle but important difference between demanding “Give me an answer” and “Please help me figure out what additional diagnostics I can run to achieve enlightenment.”\n\n\n\n5.2.4.2 Getting it wrong (and yet so wrong)\nThe second example is one from my person experience.\n\n\n\nAn email sent to the R Bugs Website, I included a large file with dump from sample command to help with debugging\n\n\nI received two different responses:\n\n\n\nA vaguely chilling RTFM style response\n\n\nSo, what happened? Well, the second response made it much more clear.\n\n\n\nA friendlier response: this was not a bug!\n\n\nSo … I had done some things right, but I had made a mistake. Sending to the r-bugs mailing list implied that I thought there was a bug. But there wasn’t, it wasn’t a problem with R, it was a problem with my computer setup. I should have sent this to another forum first, one for general support, instead I had implied that there was a bug in R. Insulting people’s work is a risky way to try to get their help!",

    "section": "5.3 Theories of motivation",
    "text": "5.3 Theories of motivation\nWhen organizational science asks about motivation we create taxonomies of different kinds of motivation.\nA classic taxonomy is “intrinsic” vs “extrinsic” motivation. These labels are usually used informally, creating a distinction between motivations/desires that are somehow located “internally” (intrinsic) and those that are located “externally” to the individual (thus extrinsic).\nInternally located motivation are things like enjoyment, fun. Externally located motivations are things that are worthwhile because of their outcomes in the world, such as getting paid, changing the world, pleasing others.\nThe distinction is useful, but is far from the end of the motivation story.\nExercise: Talk with your partner and identify:\n\nA thing you only do for fun\nA thing you only do for the rewards available\nA thing that seems both internal and external motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic)\nA thing you do that has neither.\n\nTheorists have developed more elaborate frameworks. This one is from a theory of motivation called “self-determination theory” (Ryan and Deci, 2000):\n\nThis adds an additional dimension to the “location” of motivation which they call “Perceived locus of control” which is our own sense of whether someone is forcing us to do a particular activity, or whether we understand this to be our own choice.\nIn open source, people that stick around come to develop and talk about a real identification and integration of the goals of a particular project and their own goals. Some theorists talk about this leading to strong “organizational citizenship”.\nTalking with your partner, can you identify:\n\nA situation where you do an activity because you think it is worthwhile, even if you don’t get rewards.\nA situation in which you gave up an activity you used to value … why did you give it up?\n\nOne core idea in self-determination theory is that human development and life satisfaction comes from undertaking activities that move to the right in the diagram: from externally caused through introjection, identification, and integration.",

    "text": "6.2 Lecture notes\n\n6.2.1 Copyright\n\nSource code is writing, just like a book or a poem.\nEdits are modifications, improvements create derived works, distribution makes copies\nWriting is copyrighted.\n\nOwner has the right to decide who can copy or modify\n\nViolations of a license triggered by distribution\n\ngiving to others, esp. selling\n\nPenalty for violation are:\n\nCourt order to stop distributing\nEconomic damages\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Revocation, time-limitation, and exclusivity\n\nThe text of specific copyright licenses can specify time-limits (after which they expire or change)\nOwner can release same work under many different licenses at once (as long as they are compatible).\n\nCalled dual-licensing\n\nOwner can re-license their own derivative works (but the license on the original is unchanged by that)\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Open Source Definition\nThe Open Source Initiative holds a trade mark so they can determine which licenses can be called open source. They have established the “Open Source Definition” with 10 elements (slightly abridged below):\n\n** Introduction **\n\n\nOpen source doesn’t just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:\n\n\n\nFree Redistribution\n\n\n\nThe license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software … The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.\n\n\n\nSource Code\n\n\n\n\nThe program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form … Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.\n\n\n\n\nDerived Works\n\n\n\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\n\n\nIntegrity of The Author’s Source Code\n\n\n\nThe license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of “patch files” with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.\n\n\n\nNo Discrimination Against Persons or Groups\n\n\n\nThe license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\n\n\n\nNo Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor\n\n\n\nThe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\n\n\n\nDistribution of License\n\n\n\nThe rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.\n\n\n\nLicense Must Not Be Specific to a Product\n\n\n\nThe rights attached to the program must not depend on the program’s being part of a particular software distribution…\n\n\n\nLicense Must Not Restrict Other Software\n\n\n\nThe license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.\n\n\n\nLicense Must Be Technology-Neutral\n\n\n\nNo provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Copyleft\n\nSome licenses add an additional restriction; They are called copyleft licenses (a play on the word copyright).\nItem number 3, Derived Works, says:\n\n\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\nCopyleft licenses alter this by changing “must allow” to “if distributed, must require”\n\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and if distributed must require them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\n\nCopyleft means derived works, that are distributed, cannot be licensed under a different license but must be licensed under the same license. See detailed discussion at copyleft.org\nThis is informally referred to as viral: derived works are “infected” and must all be copyleft.\nThis only applies if the changes are distributed. Usually this means distributed beyond the individual or company that owns the copyright. This means that companies can alter copyleft software, as long as they don’t let that code outside their own organization.\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Recent controversies discussion\n\n6.2.5.1 Cloud software\nThe original open source licenses were written before cloud, and the idea of Software As A Service (SAAS). Why does cloud and SAAS change a key circumstance?\n\nCloud delivery of software\n\nWhy was the Affero GPL created?\nAmazon Web Services and open source.\n\nElastic Search has created their own license. What does it do differently? Is it an open source license? Would OSI consider it to be an open source license?\n\n\n\n6.2.5.2 Artificial Intellegence software\nNeural Networks express much of their logic not in code, but in the weights of a trained neutral network.\n\nWhy does this change impact open source?\nCan trained neutral networks be modified or improved? What would be needed?\nWhat does the OpenRAILs license try to do? See Hugging Face reading above (Section 6.1).\nWould OSI judge that license to be “open source”? Which provisions, if any, might it violate?\n\n\n\n6.2.5.3 Recent license violation articles.\nhttps://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/\nDiscussed on Hacker News here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34681636\nNot just violating GPL, but likely other licenses too (not including license in distributed non-copyleft open source).\nLots of these out there, found this as searching:\nhttps://hackaday.com/2022/07/15/watch-out-for-lasercutter-manufacturers-violating-gpl/\nIncluding stories about startups whose cash out was sunk by OSS license violations:\nhttps://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-ensure-open-source-risks-wont-scuttle-your-deal/\nPoint is not to scare people from using open source, but to understand the very real meaning of the licenses. The more sophisticated understanding of open source you are gaining from this course will be an advantage in the job market.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1 Stack\nMetaphors help us build an image of the organization of complicated sociotechnical systems. In this class I discuss three key metaphors employed in the discourse around software and the organization of its production and distribution: a “stack”, a “stream” (esp. “upstream”/“downstream”) and “ecosystem”.\nWhen a programmer writes code they do so in a concrete workspace, a filesystem containing libraries which we can think of as their raw materials. That filesystem might be on a laptop, a server accessed by ssh or through a notebook server, or a docker image. Together with tools to write code (editors) and local configurations (.profile) these workspaces are called dev environments.\nThe actual code newly written by the programmer orchestrates this assemblage of code to build analyses, create graphs, do science. That code is a thin layer sitting atop a range of received code, from plotting libraries, filesystem utilities, operating systems. We refer to these chunks of code in various ways, libraries, packages, modules, services and we refer to the language used to access that code as interfaces, APIs, hooks, exposed names of methods/procedures. For any particular piece of code it is possible to trace paths of execution from the newly written code (sometimes called a “call tree”), through calls and parameter lists.\nThe way that new code “sits on top of” received code is often visible to the programmer on error when they scan the “stacktrace” looking for the location of errors and hints on how to overcome them.\nThe stack in stacktrace refers to a very specific set of memory locations and post-compiler processes of code execution, but colloquially we have come to refer to the assemblage of code underlying newly written code in the workspace as “the stack”. This metaphor makes clear the layering of dependency between code: packages called by newly written code are thought of as lying immediately below, and indeed physically supporting, the newly written code. The packages called by that first supporting layer are seen to support that layer, lying physically beneath and supporting all the layers above. Abstracting from any particular execution path of a particular piece of code, we understand packages to underlie and support any package which calls code from them, the typical patterns of usage forming a picture of hierarchy. From this understanding we get the ubiqutious “stack diagram” showing a neat layered structure. (Incidentally a “full stack” developer is one that is expected to be able to write code across the data and execution paths in locally written software, not usually “down” into the full stacktrace!).\nBeing lower in the stack is a result of having more code (especially packages which are themselves called by other packages) that calls you, and thereby being involved in a wider range of software execution paths. A filesystem module would be involved in game development and in climate change modeling; a graphing library called from code to describe election results and counting cat pictures on twitter. These different kinds of applications and analyses reflected in more specialized packages can be thought of as structures of packages stacked atop other packages, moving upwards through an ever more elaborate stack diagram, showing spires of specialization, both in application area and in higher-level language, Python vs dotNet for example. Frequently we see alternative stacks, even within specific areas, such as R vs Python datascience or even within a language group, such as R tidyverse vs “base R” vs R data.table.\nIn terms of workspaces this means that these “lower” packages were present in a wide range of different workspaces, as new code was written. In different workspaces working on different kinds of code, needing different kinds of analyses, algorithms, and capabilities, different sets of packages are present.\nHow then do packages get to workspaces?\nIn “user space” software is often obtained by visiting a website and hitting “download,” receiving an application to be copied to a location on the computer. Even much vaunted “app stores” are merely a pay-walled version of this. In “dev space” code can arrive in this way, with a user downloading source code, sometimes called a “tar-ball” after the historical tool to pack many files into one for ease of downloading, and unpacking it into their programming workspace. This is problematic, though, because the downloaded code is not useful without its dependencies, the relatively lower layers in the stack. Resolving this leads to practices that provide dependencies together with the downloaded code (through techniques such as “static compilation” or bundling). Or rather providing reduced slices of the underlying libraries, reflecting the precise execution path, rather than the full set of underlying code and its possiblities. Unsurprising when stacks of code can be large (or very large, such as the notorious TeXLive which is over a gigabyte in size). Quite quickly, installing software this way can result in multiple copies of underlying code being present on the computer, located in different bundles installed at different times and in different places. For programs in “user space” this is only mildly problematic, taking up more space than strictly needed, but space is cheap and the complexity is entirely hidden from the user.\nIn “dev space”, though, the programmer may want to access different capabilities of underlying libraries (unleashing the “innovation potential” of the “option value” inherent in “modularity” as management science would put it, see Chapter 7). As a toy example consider downloading code that sorts a list of addresses by zipcode, bundling a numeric sort from an underlying library. Should we now want to sort alphabetically we would either have to implement that ourselves with new code, or obtain the underlying library to gain the alphabetical sort capability.\nPretty soon, we would have multiple versions of the underlying library, and all the packages underlying them, lying chaotically around the filesystem, each installed at different times and having sometimes subtly different behaviors. Given the complexities of the many ways that compilers look for and prioritize code this can lead to immensely frustrating confusions (Any one that has struggled to understand the PATH parameter in Java, or been stymied by a stray .py file named the same as an obscure library, will attest). This situation will result in code that is hard to reuse because it is heavily dependent on the location in which it is written, with hardcoded paths, and special cases.",

Examples include Python’s pip, Perl’s CPAN, R’s CRAN, Javascript’s npm, and Java’s Maven, as well as operating system distributions (such as Debian’s apt-get) and cross-language collections such as Homebrew, SBGrid, and Anaconda. All subtly different, their vision includes an installation tool that programmers use to identify the high-level library they want to access, a well-specified location for installed software. They include a metadata scheme to describe dependencies and a graph traversal approach to “resolve dependencies”. Together this allows programmers to install libraries and have the package manager take care of ensuring a minimal and coordinated install of underlying packages.\nPackage managers also enable programmers to smoothly update the libraries in their workspaces to newer versions, taking care of the cascading need for updates further down in the stack. Yet not all packages are ready to interact with newer versions of down stack packages, packager managers can also keep older versions installed and available to those parts of the stack that need them (sometimes called “pinning”). The ability of packager manager to update software stacks means that novel capabilities can be distributed out to potential programmer users, while facilitating stability and coordination across the installed stack in individual programmer workspaces.",

    "section": "10.3 Stream",
    "text": "10.3 Stream\n\nhttps://www.mountainhearth.com/2015/02/rivulets.html\nThe production system that produces the stack is spoken about as a stream.\nThe stream flows along paths defined by dependency links and, over time, things move along these links, new capabilities, approaches, and sometimes bugs and problems!\nThe language here is far from precise (and confusing if one thinks too literally!), but in general packages lower in the stack are considered to be “upstream” (towards the source) and packages closer to specialized users, are considered to be “downstream” (even though they are higher in the stack diagrams).\nThe image is of rivulets, diverging into smaller and smaller specialized paths akin to the “spires” in the stack metaphor.\nThe stream analogy is particularly useful when thinking about how changes spread out, becoming used by nearby packages, and eventually making their way to programmer’s workspaces via package managers.\nConsider a new piece of software functionality, such as a novel analysis, a new data structure, or a bug-fix. In a concrete sense these originate in a specific programmers workspace and must be distributed to spread out to eventual users. In practice this means that the change has to travel back “upstream” before traveling “downstream” through the packager manager managed flow that will eventually bring it to the workspaces of other developers.\nThat “upstream” flow likely starts with a push from the programmer’s local filesystem, into their repository hosted online (e.g., github). If the change is instantiated as a new package itself, it can make its way into the package management flow through submission to a package manager (which pulls from the repository, confirms dependency information, builds, tests, and publishes the package and its documentation).\nIf the change is not a new package itself, but an edit to an existing package, before that change can enter the flow and travel downstream to programmers, the change needs to move from the individual programmer’s repository into the main repository for the package. In this case the individual programmer’s repository is a “fork” of the main package repository, which means that the repository hosting service (github, gitlab etc) stores the connection between the repositories, making it easy to initiate a “pull request” (colloquially called a PR). A PR is a note to the maintainers of the destination package repository that a proposed change is available and ready for pickup. The maintainers, change author, and package community, can then test and discuss the change. If appropriate, the maintainers can “merge the PR” bringing the change into the development version of the package, to be included in a new versioned release submitted to the package manager.\nChanges thus enter the package manager facilitated flow, and travel down paths defined by dependency relationships.\nThe speed at which changes travel depends on a few factors. Perhaps a user of the package is watching the PR and ready to rapidly update the code in their workspace to tackle an analysis issue on a deadline, or perhaps an update of dependencies happens as a downstream package is getting ready to deploy updates of their own by “rolling” up a new release. Updates can also be quite slow, as end-user scientists return months later to previous workflows after collecting new data or inventing new techniques. Updates flowing can also be blisteringly quick, in that package management systems or individual package projects themselves can undertake “continuous integration” which means automatically updating all components frequently (daily or even on every commit of new code). Continuous integration is an approach to gain early insight into issues caused by changes in the underlying stack.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/mrhayata/6933963596\nAs changes propagate downstream they bring with them implications and work. A package project updating dependencies may be receiving new opportunities, new ways to simplify and implement long-standing desires of the project and its users, unlocking a flurry of consequential activity and excitement in the receiving project.\nOr, less sanguinely, a project may discover that their code no longer builds, due to “breaking changes” in the underlying libraries, requiring the receiving project to either resolve these issues through local workarounds or adaptations, or essentially reject the flow of changes by “pinning” their dependency to an earlier version.\nPerhaps more pernicious still are changes in behavior of underlying libraries that are not obvious at build time, and don’t show up in batteries of tests, but only when a package is in use in the field. Thus a change in an underlying library can appear benign but lead to confusing bug reports. These issues can take time to trace to the changed dependency, appearing at first to be newly discovered issues in the receiving project’s own evolving code. Even when the issue is traced to the change in the dependency, work is still implied as the package developers have to now act as users of the underlying dependency and report the issue to the “upstream” package. Developers can try to exhort their own users to report the issue upstream, but the intricacies of just how the issue in the dependency is causing the problem in the user space often requires protracted, three-way discussions between the downstream user, the developers of the package being immediately used, and the developers of the underlying dependency.\nAn appreciation of the scale of the work implied by package updates comes into focus when one recognizes that each change arriving at each downstream package can cause changes at the receiving package, and those reaction changes are themselves incorporated in new releases and thus moved into the flow, and themselves travel to their own downstream packages and users, each potentially kicking off new rounds of changes, a cascade of reactions to reactions to reactions, reverberating and criss-crossing throughout the network of package dependencies.\nThe pressure to be up to date (and thus the pressure to undertake the adaptation work needed) comes not only from the new opportunities offered by changes, but also because it is far easier to get insight and help from both developers and fellow users when encountering problems or learning about software when one is working with relatively recent code. Not only are developers more aware of how recent versions work, they are far more likely to be motivated to help, both to explain the work they have recently done and share the new opportunities they are bringing to downstream users, but also to identify, characterize, and resolve possible bugs introduced. Finally, issues faced by users can stem from bugs already fixed, so “getting on the same page” is seen as respectful of package developers and active users time.",

    "text": "10.4 Ecosystem\nHow then from stream to ecosystem? The packages seem to be alive, altering the landscape on which other packages live, creating and consuming resources of time, attention, and opportunities. But to really grasp the core of the ecosystem metaphor we must take a detour to the question of how researchers come to locate software.\nSurprisingly little is known about the uptake of software by developers, including how they first hear of packages, how they investigate and evaluate packages, and the path from initial discovery to regular use (and the path by which software falls out of use). Different kinds of paths may exist for different kinds of software, especially differing as software is closer to the scientific method frontier. For example, perhaps PIs or senior personnel are more involved in the selection of packages which closely model and implement scientific theories and analyses, while decisions about dataflow and execution infrastructure are taken by more junior developers.\nThe literature on software choice has largely developed in the user-space domain, and particularly around enterprise software. Typically this highlights usability, and perceived ease of use. When the choice is between programming libraries, rather than point-and-click software these factors may express themselves differently. For example it seems very likely that useability and perceived ease of use are thought of in terms of compatibility with existing toolchains. These compatibilities are sometimes spoken of as “affinities” and include aspects such as language, data format expectations (input, output, and working data structures), design philosophies expressed in software architectures. In analysis code, undoubtedly scientific domain or topic reflect affinities as well. These affinities are likely related to (or even signaled by) overlapping developers and supporters (both individuals and organizations), developing in a structurational way. Additional affinities might include well known examples of use, such as in widely read blogs ((this is why Articles are aggregated in Runiverse)), conference presentations, tutorials, or discussions on Q&A sites/forums/mailing lists.\nThese affinities give rise to the feeling of physical closeness between packages which is core to how developers discuss code. This idea of closeness is reflected in the metaphors employed, from calling packages “nearby” talking about “neighborhoods” and “communities”, as well as grouping into vertical/horizontal closeness in the “stack” metaphor, and geographic connection in the “stream” metaphor. In particular as package affinities develop, giving rise to downstream packages, the language expresses not only closeness of packages with affinities, but a clustering, a tightening of affinities and links within the cluster and de-emphasis of links across clusters, leading to a perception of separateness.\nThis idea can be seen in the language of “software ecosystems”, usually reflecting a cluster around some central artifact or library. The core element of that metaphor is closeness and the provision of services to each other, relatively local relationships that enable collective, sustained, evolving function. Ecosystems, as they become denser, also develop new functionality, perhaps coming to be alternatives to software already in that “space”. Here the ecosystem metaphor again invokes the ecological idea of competition for space, and the resources that space implies, albeit with deep vagueness about whether users, developer time, or option-value from dependencies, are the things being competed for.\n\nEcosystems can be nested, with specific ecosystems embedded within more general software clusters. As one zooms out more expansive metaphors of space and connection are used, including planet and universe, but generally the idea of embedded ecosystems continues to work well. For example, one might say that the ggplot ecosystem is embedded in the tidyverse which is embedded in the R ecosystem which is embedded in the data science ecosystem. Generally, though, the metaphor seems most apt for clusters of software that are scaled so that individuals can monitor and perceive activity.",

    "text": "11.1 Iterative Development\nThe coordination of work in open source is assisted by three practices: iterative development, regression tests, and continuous integration.\nIterative development has at its core the idea that the best way to know what to build is to get a product into a users hands quickly, collect feedback, then iterate.\nTest suites allow a programming group to define expected behaviors and verify them using software tests. Then, when changes are introduced to the codebase, the test suite can show that the changes have not accidentally altered the expected behaviors.\nContinuous Integration encourages frequent merging of developing code, running the test suite to ensure that nothing is merged to main unless all the tests pass.\nIn software engineering, iterative development is contrasted with “the waterfall model”. Whereas “waterfall” is understood as a rigid structure of software planning and execution where each phase is complete and validated before moving to the next phase. Usually these phases involve at least Requirements, Design, Implementation, Deployment, Maintenance. The core idea is to be efficient and effective by knowing what should be built, having a careful and validated design, then write code optimized to that design, before rolling out a complete product that can be maintained at lower cost.\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/waterfall-model\nIn contrast, Iterative development expects many short repeated cycles of build, release, feedback, and redesign. A team doing iterative development seeks to quickly produce working software and get it in front of potential users. A core idea here is that it is hard for potential users to describe their requirements in the abstract, but it is easier for them to give feedback when they have something “in their hands”. This is because people think more clearly when their bodies are involved (an idea called “embodied cognition”) or at least real things like actual documents or real data in a database, more closely approximating the situation in which they would be using the software (an idea called “situated cognition).\nThere are many useful comparisons of agile and iterative development, including the Medium article that contains this figure.\nIterative development plays a key role in open source. Open source projects typically do not undertake user research, but instead build things that work for the core developers. Those products then find their way into users hands. Users working directly with existing software then conceptualize improvements or identify flaws, some users then take the time to give feedback through Issues or bug reports, creating new ideas for developers to potentially implement.\nIterative development is part of what has become known as “Agile methods” and “Scrum” but those are more elaborate approaches to managing software development which are appropriate for companies and teams with employees.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development\n“Giddings, R. V. (1984). Accommodating Uncertainty in Software Design. Commun.

    "text": "11.2 Test Suites\nYet iterative development means lots of change. Changes come from within the project (new contributions, bug fixes) but also from outside the project, including changes in dependencies. Dependency changes come not only from bug-fixes, but also from new features in dependencies which offer new opportunities but also require changes in the codebase. Change can also come from periodic “clean ups” or “refactoring” efforts to reduce duplication and make a codebase easier to work with.\nAs code builds up over time the original intentions of developers can become less clear. While documentation (separate written guides to the code) can help, there is little motivation to write documentation and keep it up to date.\nTest suites offer the opportunity to record the expected behavior of software. A software test provides an expected output (or behavior), identifies the code which should provide that output, and provides a way to run the code (often together with known input), and to compare expected vs actual output.\nhttps://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-testing-in-python/creating-tests-with-pytest?ex=2\nTest suites can also include a sort of meta-test that examines which lines of code are run when all the tests are run, then reports “coverage” to show what proportion of code has actually been tests.",

CI encourages frequent merging of developing code, running the test suite to ensure that nothing is merged to main unless all the tests pass.\nIn projects that use CI, when a developer is creating a PR, the system will, in the background, run the test suite and see if all tests pass. Depending on the project policies, the developer may be able to continue to create the PR if the tests are failing, or the project may require that all tests pass even before a PR is created.\nIn GitHub, CI is enabled by by Github Actions. You can think of these as scripts that are executed on GitHub servers, kicked off by events within the GitHub system.

You can think of these as akin to source code files.\nWe will set up a table like in the image below, with two spaces for each person: their “working area” (right in front of them) and their “repository” (just further in front).\nGit stores full versions of our working areas. This means all the files and folders in our source code project. Git stores full copies of work as it was. In our exercise we will use a folded piece of white paper as a proxy. Think of it like a tray on which all our work sits. We will have lots of copies of these workspaces.\nIn this exercise we will be making lots of copies. And that is, fundamentally, how git works. For this reason it is really important that you take the time to make the needed copies.\nWe will need to make a new copy of a workspace each time work moves around. As we’ll see that will happen when work moves out of a repository.\nOur commit will be a creased piece of paper, with a paper plane on it, together with a name for the commit and a comment. We will write the name and comment directly on the creased piece of paper. The name we will use will be the letter V followed by three random letters. Examples could be VKKT or VGTD or VLLT. No need to worry about sequences, these are just names.\nHere is an example of this exercise underway, see lots of copies of the postit planes and the white commit trays.\nOur first scenario will be sequential work, meaning that the Originator works, then Improver1, then Improver2, but none working at the same time.  1. The originator creates a commit, with a basic plane. Mark this with a name (e.g., VKKF or VEDS) and a comment (e.g., My first attempt).

    "text": "14.2 Why rewind?\nWhen we are working we often want to try things out before we are 100% sure that they will work. We want to be able to experiment and find our way through a problem. If our experiment doesn’t work, we want to be able to step backwards in time, to find an earlier version that is a good new starting point.\nIn many ways this is identical to the idea of a “save point” in a game. We can step backwards in time and try again. We can reload that point at any time in the future. In our paper plane analogy, we can reach out and grab any tray in our repository.\nGit enables us to save full copies of our working directory. We can then get back to the state of our work at any time we made a commit. When we check out a historical state, we get the files and the folders as as they were. So git actually swaps out the directory.\nWhen I first started using git, I found this a bit confusing. usually when one restores from a backup, it is more like downloading a file. One gets to choose:\n\nwhat to call the newly obtained older version\nwhere to put it\nwhat to do if there is a file that would be over-written.\n\nWhat git does, though, is it swaps out all the files and folders with the previous version.\nAs we’ve seen, though, git is more fine-grained than a video game save-point. We often have files that have changed that we don’t want included in our save-point, this is why we have the git add stage before git commit.\nThus we can have untracked files or folders hanging around in our working folder. Git won’t change these when we do a checkout. So what happens is:\n\ngit checks that all tracked files are in a “clean” state. This means that they are unchanged from the last commit. This is git checking that you have “saved your work” before it swaps out the files.\ngit goes to its repository, locates the commit you ask for, and swaps all the tracked files and folders in the working directory.\ngit remembers what commit you’ve moved to, so that if you make edits you can decide how they should be applied into the stream of commits in your repository.\n\nQuestion for you to answer: What happens to untracked files when you run a git checkout\nTo move backwards in time we use the git checkout command. We have to let git know which commit we want to go back to. We can specify that using the name that git uses, which is the hash (e.g., 1b2162e) shown by git log.\nStarting with our 3 commit test-rewind repo:\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 50590c5 (HEAD -&gt; main) made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e made first edit\nWe can move to the first commit using\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git checkout 1b2162e\nwhich produces the output\nNote: switching to '1b2162e'.\n\nYou are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n\n  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\n\nOr undo this operation with:\n\n  git switch -\n\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n\nHEAD is now at 1b2162e made first edit\nIf we run our viz command we can see a little more:\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 50590c5 (main) made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e (HEAD) made first edit\nSee how the word HEAD now appears on the bottom line and not the top line? This is git’s way of telling us what is checked out.\nWhen git says detached HEAD (a little intense sounding) git is highlight for us that our current working directory is not at the last commit. This means that if we try to make a new commit git wants us to know that it won’t just pop onto the top of the repo like usual.\nFor now, though, we can inspect files back at this version, and we can shift to another version (using checkout). For example we can move back to our top commit, using git checkout main.\nIf you see a error: pathspec 'main' did not match any file(s) known to git use git checkout master (newer git installs use main and older installs use master).\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git checkout main\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 50590c5 (HEAD -&gt; main) made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e made first edit\nNotice how HEAD now points to the top commit? If we edit/add/commit our commits will drop back on top.\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git add README \njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git commit -m \"Made fourth edit\"\n[main ff7997b] Made fourth edit\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* ff7997b (HEAD -&gt; main) Made fourth edit\n* 50590c5 made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e made first edit\nWhile we can always use the hash abbreviations like 50590c5 as names for commits, there is also a relative syntax.\ngit checkout HEAD~1\nwill get the commit one back from where HEAD is currently pointing. HEAD~2 will be 2 back, and so on. HEAD~ (without any number after the tilde) is a shortcut for HEAD~1\nRemember, git swaps out all the tracked files when you do a checkout. If you have untracked files you will find they are unaffected by a git checkout. Create a file called my-untracked-file run git status then run git checkout &lt;earlier-commit&gt; (where &lt;earlier-commit&gt; is a hash for your first commit), then run git status again.",

In git language we use git add we are “staging” a set of changes ready to commit. If we run git status we will see the files added under Changes to be committeed (usually shown in green).\nSometimes we accidentally add files with changes that we don’t want to include in the commit (e.g., because they are unrelated to the current set of changes and would just clutter the commit up for people trying to understand it)\nHelpful, the output of git status helps coach us how to fix this. We can use git restore --staged &lt;file&gt; This works with individual files, but &lt;file&gt; can also refer to a folder, in which case all the files inside that folder will be unstaged.",

Git is like a “ledger” in accounting that provides an “audit trail”: we can’t just easily delete something from history. Instead we can make a commit that reverses the mistake. One analogy that I like is that if the mistaken commit is “matter” then the revert commit is “anti-matter”, it exactly reverses all the changes of the mistaken commit. See https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/\nThis does leave the history looking a bit messy. We will explore other opportunities to tidy things up later in the course. One note at this point: if things like passwords get into the git history, it can be very difficult to entirely eliminate them from the history (and one never knows if others have unchanged copies) so generally if passwords or other secrets (like API keys) get into a git repository then it’s time to change the password or secret!",

Branching helps us to do this.\nOne option might be to maintain different versions of files using different file names (report_script.Rmd and new_report_script.Rmd. This becomes very messy when we have many files and folders involved (/images and /new_images???). This is even worse when we have multiple experiments and attempts going on in parallel and entirely hopeless when we move online and are working with groups of people.\nRecall, though, that git enables us to “swap out” our working directory. Until now we’ve kept this linear, each new version added after the last. But branching enables us to keep parallel lines of commits (as though we had two lines of trays with on our paper plane repository table).",

The online sales system updated and the data files now include a new column saying whether a sale was cash or credit. You know how to get things working again, but you still aren’t ready to launch your chart system. You don’t want to wait until your chart work is finished to get the report going again.\nSo you switch to master, edit the reporting file to handle the new column, then add and commit the change.\ngit checkout master\nSwitched to branch 'master'\nNow we are back on the master branch and we won’t see our work towards the charts at all. So over on the towards_chart branch we can work away without upsetting the working code on master.\nCheck the current content of the script (will show nothing about charts)\ncat reporting_script.Rmd\nInitial code for table report\nSo now we can, without involving our work towards the chart, make the bugfix on master.\necho \"# Fix to match new data format\" &gt;&gt; reporting_script.Rmd\ngit add reporting_script.Rmd\ngit commit -m \"A fix to match new data format\"\nNow if we run our git viz command:\ngit log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\nwe will see our branching starting to show up:\njlh5498@educcomp04:~/scratch_branching$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 48afd7c (HEAD -&gt; master) A fix to match new data format\n| * 5c7fc76 (towards_chart) More work towards charts\n| * c72d745 Worked towards charts\n|/  \n* c434df6 starting setup\nHappily the report runs fine on Wednesday night.\nThursday morning you switch back to the towards_chart branch and are pleased to get things working.\ngit checkout towards_chart\necho \"# Code to finalize the charts\" &gt;&gt; reporting_script.Rmd \ngit add reporting_script.Rmd\ngit commit -m \"Finished up the charts\"\nYou are ready to add the chart into the report by moving the code to the master branch.\nBut if you just merge the code back to master you may find that the code for the chart doesn’t work with the change to handle the updated data files. So you may have some merging to do. But you don’t know if you can get that done before the report has to run, and you don’t want to get caught fiddling with master because if the report tries to run you could end up with nothing going out that night.\nSo you first merge master over to your towards_chart branch, and ensure that things work well and the two pieces of work done in parallel work well together (charts and dealing with the new column).\nFirst confirm which branch you are in, this command lists the branches and the one highlighted with the * is the current branch. git status can also show you.\ngit branch -v \ngit branch -v\n  master          576bc90 A fix to match new data format\n* towards_chart bef7b72 Finished up the charts\nThen merge over the master branch into the towards_chart branch.\ngit merge master\nAuto-merging reporting_script.Rmd\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in reporting_script.Rmd\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\nAh, good thing we did this on the branch because we do end up with a conflict. Git can resolve some conflicts but not all. Git shows conflicts by adding special lines of text into the file (using &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; as indicators. To resolve them we remove those lines and leve the file the way we want it to be.\n# Initial code for table report\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n# Work towards charts\n# More work towards charts\n# Code to finalize the charts\n=======\n# Fix to match new data format\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; master\nThe parts separated by ======== show edits that conflict. Looking at this we can see that we want all the lines, so we edit the file to show:\n# Initial code for table report\n# Fix to match new data format\n# Work towards charts\n# More work towards charts\n# Code to finalize the charts\nNow we can save that file. Git knows that we are fixing a conflict, so git status shows:\nOn branch towards_chart\nYou have unmerged paths.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\n  (use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to mark resolution)\n    both modified:   reporting_script.Rmd\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nAnd now we can add and commit to finish the merge.\ngit add reporting_script.Rmd\ngit commit -m \"merged bug fix with charts code\"\n[towards_chart e420a05] merged bug fix with charts code\n(Git can only flag syntactical conflicts, not semantic conflicts, so one would also try running some test reports to make sure things are all working).\nSo once you’ve resolved all issues, then you can merge the towards_chart branch back to master, signalling that you are ready to launch your new report with charts.\ngit checkout master\ngit merge towards_chart\nSwitched to branch 'master'\nUpdating 576bc90..e420a05\nFast-forward\n reporting_script.Rmd | 3 +++\n 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)\nFinally we can visualize this branching, editing, and merging in two ways.

This places them on an equal footing with other contributors, so everyone else can follow the work and comment on it. Maintainers can make a pull request from a branch in their repository to another branch (usually main/main).\nThis gives us another insight: a Github pull request is from a branch to another branch; it doesn’t matter if those branches are in forked repos or in the same repo.\n\nMaintainer should clone the shared repo\n\ngit clone MAINTAINER_URL\nIf the maintainer then runs:\ngit remote -v\nthey will see:\norigin  MAINTAINER_URL (fetch)\norigin  MAINTAINER_URL (push)\nSo … for the maintainer (the owner of the shared repo) the shared repo on their clone is called origin, but those the maintainers (who are working through a fork) it is called upstream.

They add, commit, push to their forks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that these edits are incompatible, so they will generate a conflict when we try to merge them below.\nThey are incompatible because git can’t automatically merge them. Git works line by line and is quite smart (able to notice the insertion of lines, for example) but some merging of work needs human attention.\n\n\n\nContributor A and Contributor B should then go to github and look at their animal-branch on their forks. They should create a pull request by hitting the ‘New Pull Request’ button. Note that the pull request’s may not say “Able to automatically merge” (but go ahead and create the PR anyway.)\nWith everyone looking at Maintainer’s computer, Maintainer should refresh the github page for the shared repository and will see two pull-requests in the pull-request tab.\n\nThe maintainer should merge contributorA’s branch. This should merge cleanly since contributorA directly edited the lion line that the maintainer wrote.\nHowever, the second pull request will create a merge conflict. So the maintainer will have to resolve the conflict.\n\n\n\nViewing a PR on GitHub that will not merge cleanly, simple fixes can be applied via Resolve Conflicts button highlighted in purple\n\n\n\n17.5.1 Resolving merge conflict\nFor small edits like this, we can edit the file on the github website.\nThe maintainer can choose whatever contributions they want:\n\nthe original line\nthe line from ContributorA\nthe line from ContributorB\nBoth lines\nAny other decision they make\n\nTo show a conflict, git inserts special lines into the file, using these characters: &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ======== and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While those are present, git will not let us continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis way of showing a comparison between files is called a diff. You can read more about diffs. e.g., A tutorial on diff and diff format\n\n\nTo resolve the conflict we have to remove those lines. As long as they are gone, git will accept whatever is in the file as the new desired state. Git is only working at the syntax level, it does not check the semantics of the file (e.g., whether the code runs, or whether the resulting document is readable or logically consistent.)\nThe maintainer should see the file marked with a conflict like:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nlion contributorA\n=======\nlion contributorB\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; animal-branch-contributorB\ntiger\nleopard\nturtle\nWe can read this as follows:\n\nThe code in HEAD has “contributorA” next to lion. But the code in animal-branch-contributorB has conflicting code for that line, showing “contributorB” next to line.\n\nThe maintainer should go ahead and remove the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ======== and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines, then save the file.\nTo let git know we are done resolving a conflict we need to then git add and git commit that file. If we are editing on GitHub that is done automatically for us.\n\nEach person should then synchronize their local repos.\n\nFor the Maintainer that just means git pull (since they have a direct clone of upstream).\nFor Contributor B and Contributor A they have to first get the changes in upstream, then push them to their fork.\n\ngit pull upstream main\ngit push",

    "section": "",
    "text": "18.1 Split before submit\nSometimes maintainers like part of the work that a contributor has done, but they don’t like all of it.\nIn this situation, a maintainer might respond to a pull request by asking you to split your contributions into a few different pull requests. This can help keep different contributions separate, smaller, and make them easier to discuss. You might remember the importance of small layers from the week on Coordination and discussion of the Superposition paper in Chapter 7.\nOne common cause of mixing up different pieces of work in one pull request is forgetting to change branches in your repo. If you add additional commits to that branch then they will get added to the pull request. Remember, a pull request says, “Please come to this repo and get everything on this branch.” So it’s not the same as including some commits in a zip file and mailing them, it’s more like placing things into a particular spot (like a mailbox or dead-drop in a spy movie), and telling people to pick them up from there.\nSo you can always add additional things before the person comes to pick them up.\nThis is useful because if there is a conversation around the pull request then you can easily update things. For example, if someone said “Please fix a typo or pull from upstream before we consider your pull request,” you’d be able to do so without opening another PR (just add, commit, push to your branch on your fork and the PR is updated).\nHowever, it is an issue if you accidentally add new commits to a branch before a pull request is accepted. Now your pull request has two sets of commits: the first set you meant to include and the second set you didn’t. This mistake is particularly easy to make if you are developing on the main branch in your fork (which you shouldn’t do), but also happens if you are have more than one contribution that you are working on, as when you are doing something else while waiting for a PR to be accepted. If you’ve accidentally added too many files to your pull request—something that is easy to do if you use git add * or some variant—you’ll also find yourself needing to remove content from your PR.\nThis is where the delightfully named git cherry-pick can help us.\nThings would be better if you had created a new branch for the first set of commits, then a second branch for your second set of commits, never adding either set to your main branch and following the “always work on a (short-lived) feature branch” rule. Then each set of commits would be “sent” through a different pull request.\nIn other words we would be in good position to submit two separate pull requests:\ngitGraph\n  commit id: \"main1\"\n  commit id: \"main2\"\n  commit id: \"branch here\" type: HIGHLIGHT\n  branch first_set\n  commit id: \"apple1\"\n  commit id: \"apple2\"\n  checkout main\n  branch second_set\n  commit id: \"orange1\"\n  commit id: \"orange2\"\nBut instead we have everything mixed up together on one branch.\ngitGraph\n  commit id: \"main1\"\n  commit id: \"main2\"\n  commit id: \"branch here\" type: HIGHLIGHT\n  branch all_mixed_up\n  commit id: \"apple1\"\n  commit id: \"orange1\"\n  commit id: \"apple2\"\n  commit id: \"orange2\"\nWe might have forgotten to branch at all, and so have everything stuck on main\ngitGraph\n  commit id: \"main1\"\n  commit id: \"main2\"\n  commit id: \"branch here\" type: HIGHLIGHT\n  commit id: \"apple1\"\n  commit id: \"orange1\"\n  commit id: \"apple2\"\n  commit id: \"orange2\"",

Until now when we’ve created a branch we have done so while sitting at HEAD but git allows us to create a branch back in time. Git does this by adding metadata to the earlier commit (labeling it with a branch label).\nThen we can move the commits using git cherry-pick. Note that this doesn’t move them from the main branch, but creates new commits with the same content. This is very much like copying files from one directory into another directory (except we are moving commits from a branch to another branch).\ngit cherry-pick 91abdfb 423ad05\nAgain the strings 91abdfb and 423ad05 identify specific commits. We can provide a list (like above), just one, and it is also possible to provide a range if you want a full sequence of commits.\nAfter the cherry-pick we see:\njlh5498@educcomp04:~/github_repos/i320d-needs-split$ git cherry-pick 91abdfb 423ad05\n[apple_branch 9ca623a] apple1\n Date: Wed Mar 1 15:31:38 2023 -0600\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n[apple_branch 2b82f41] apple2\n Date: Wed Mar 1 15:31:38 2023 -0600\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\njlh5498@educcomp04:~/github_repos/i320d-needs-split$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 2b82f41 (HEAD -&gt; apple_branch) apple2\n* 9ca623a apple1\n| * c70df5a (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) orange2\n| * 423ad05 apple2\n| * 4f1fe99 orange1\n| * 91abdfb apple1\n|/  \n* 8e35b12 branch here\n* ea4d580 main1\n* 252ff3f Initial commit\nWe can then use git push as normal to push the apple_branch up to the fork and make a pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoving around commits using cherry-pick shows us why it is so important to understand commits as full copies of the state of the working directory, as full snapshots of our files. If commits were just the changes (just a bunch of diffs) then we would have to apply them in the order they were created, otherwise we’d get nonsense results.\nBut because commits are full copies of everything, we can move them around without any logical problems. Think of reordering the trays with the paper planes we used in the first class.\nIn fact, all that git is doing is re-writing the parent for each commit.\nAnd branches are just like little post-its added to some commits, they are just metadata pointers. Neat, isn’t it?\nSee more about this on the GitHub blog https://github.blog/2020-12-17-commits-are-snapshots-not-diffs/\n\n\n\n\n18.1.3 Exercises\n\n18.1.3.1 Individual Exercises\n\nNow you work to get the orange_branch organized.\n\n\n\n18.1.3.2 Group Exercise\nGroups of 3.

    "text": "19.1 Adding squash\nThat is also a common request from maintainers, and one that can cause confusion for new contributors.\nWhen one is working on a problem, others may be working in parallel. And their parallel work may be finished before one’s own work is. Thus the starting point for one person’s work (branching point) can “go stale” making it harder to integrate.\nWhile git merge and resolving syntax level conflicts can resolve some of this, it is often easier to understand and review work if it is presented as changes against an updated starting point.\nAs a concrete example imagine a project to build a dashboard.\nImagine that you fork the repo in January to implement a new type of visualization (let’s say a pie chart). You work on this during January and February, finally nailing it down at the start of March. Meanwhile, though, others in the project have spent February introducing a whole new way of accessing databases.\nBy the time you make a pull request at the start of March things have changed a lot since you branched in January.\nIf you submit a PR without updating, the maintainers will likely ask you to update your branch to make it work with the new database system.\nFirst thing to do is to update your local repository with the changes from upstream.\nThen you could try two options:\nOption 1 is possible, but often merging your work involves touching parts of the system you don’t know what much about and is better left to the core developers. In addition, merging in this way leaves merge commit messages and some projects really don’t like those because they make the history harder to read. It also leaves all of your “intermediate” commits in the history (things like “fix typo” and “forgot comma”). Some find that too much information.\nOption 2 is generally preferred, since it focuses on clear communication via PRs that are easier to read and review. Often this just means a single commit showing the differences between the most updated work and the work that you want to contribute. For those viewing the history, it will be just the same as if pie_chart_branch was created in late February and you did all the work very quickly!\nOption 2 is called rebase. We specify a new starting point, and git gives us a little UI in which we can choose which commits to include, which to “squash”, and we can even reorder commits.\nWe have an example set up. First we will clone it, change directory into the repo, and then switch to the pie_chart_branch.\nThen, to make git happy, be sure to set your user and email (this happens because DataCamp resets these variables from session to session):\nOur git viz command (See Section A.3 to set up) shows us the situation:\nWe have two branches (main and pie_chart_branch). pie_chart_branch branched off from main at “second commit”, and since then more work has been added to main (the database related commits). We also have three separate commits for pie_chart_branch.\nSo, in a prettier diagram, the situation looks like this:\nBut we want it to look as though pie_chart_branch came off the tip of main, like this:\nTo accomplish this we can use a git command called rebase. We say that we will “rebase” the pie_chart_branch against main.\nThis puts us into a textual UI, with guidance at the bottom. We can use the arrow keys to move around. In this UI we are editing a text file (so we are using the Nano editor). Each line is a commit, the lines are instructions and are executed in order.\nWe use Ctrl + O to save (aka “write-Out”) and Ctrl+X to exit the editor. We should see a count of commits being rebased and then a message about a successful rebase. Using git viz will then show us:\nThis is a little hard to read. This is because the origin/ branches are shwoing (and those are up on the GitHub server and not yet changed). Look closely at the pie_chart_branch and down the left column. We now see that pie chart 1 commit comes directly after the two commits on main, just as though the work started there.\nTo get this to also be reflected on the server we would have to do a “force push” git push -f which makes the server reflect the local repo. Note that this is usual for rebase on branches, but one should be very hesitant with any force operations on main or a branch shared with others. (Since you are not the owners of the repo, you won’t be able to do a force push here). After the force push, things are neater:\nYou might be thinking, didn’t we do pretty much the same thing with cherrypick? And yes, in this situation rebase is very similar to cherrypick.\nRebase does offer some additional opportunities though. Notice that the textual UI shows more options than just ‘pick’. One otion is ‘squash’ which takes changes from multiple commits and presents them in a single commit. This can make a git history easier for teammates to understand.\nWe want to squash those three commits down to one commit, and (like before) we want that commit to represent changes as though we had branched off main after the database 2 commit. First, remove the directory we have been working in and reset things with a new clone.\nJust as before we use:\nThis puts us back into a textual UI, with guidance at the bottom. This time instead of leaving all three as ‘pick’ we change two of them to squash. We do this by editing the file so that two of the lines show s instead of pick.\nAfter we use Ctrl + O to save (aka “write-Out”) and Ctrl+X to exit the editor, git completes the squash by including all the changes in a single commit. We are then returned to the editor to create a new commit message.\nFinally, we can use git viz to see the new situation.\nIgnore the remote branch (origin/pie_chart_branch), and focus only on the local branch (HEAD -&gt; pie_chart_branch). Instead of all three commits, we now only see a single commit (c367b8a).\nNote that in these examples we did not encounter any conflicts (because edits were all on different files). In reality, though, when commits are moved around, rebased, and squashed, sometimes those operations result in conflicts (just as happens with merge). In that case git add the conflict symbols (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and ========== and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) which all need to be removed, then the files added and finally we run git rebase --continue. Git does provide useful messages through that process with guidance on the likely next steps.",

Simultaneously when we are working in the open that means that anyone can view any file that was ever in a repository. With that in mind it is not too surprising that if you accidentally add something to git and then push it to github you can have trouble putting “the genie back in the bottle.”\nLet’s say that we create a repo and add a README, then add a SPECIAL_SECRET file with the password “swordfish” in it.

Or rather it is not in our working directory. The problem is that it is still inside out .git folder and we can get it out easily.\ngit checkout HEAD~1\nNote: checking out 'HEAD~1'.\n\nYou are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:\n\n  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\n\nHEAD is now at 4d51f91... README edit 2\nlsREADME         SPECIAL_SECRET\ncat SPECIAL_SECRET\nswordfish\nHere I just used git checkout HEAD~1 which goes one commit back in time, to before we deleted the SPECIAL_SECRET file. Even if we were far ahead, or over on other branches etc, I could always get back by asking to see the code just after the commit that added the file git checkout 018f6b5 (btw, to get out of DETACHED HEAD state just checkout the branch again, we’re working on main so it would be git checkout main).\nSo using git rm removes a file from the working directories but it doesn’t remove it from the git history. And that’s a sensible thing, usually you want to be able to go back in time. But sometimes you want to remove something from the history entirely. You can do that using the approaches outlined by Github here: Removing sensitive data from a repository\nThe process is a bit complex (as it should be) but simplified with the bfg tool, as described at the link above. First you have to download the tool (which requires Java to run) then follow the instructions step by step.\nKeep in mind that if you had pushed this sensitive info to a repo on github and others had then forked or cloned it then that info is not going to be deleted from the clones, so passwords should definitely be changed and you should ask everyone to delete forks/clones and start again.\nThere are a set of approaches to avoid uploading sensitive data. A good starting point is discipline around using .gitignore which will prevent adding files that should not be added. Another approach is to become familiar with using environment variables to hold secrets. This is an evolving area, so ask others in your organization how they handle secrets (usually access credentials) when using git. One recent approach (specific to GitHub is https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)",

Then, when changes are introduced to the codebase, the test suite can show that the changes have not accidentally altered the expected behaviors.\nThey help with the challenge of coordination among developers as codebases change, serving as an executable reminder of developers intentions.\nIn this class we will get some experience with writing and executing multiple tests (making a “test suite”). We will get to the point where individual contributors can run the tests prior to making a PR, serving as an individual level check. In the class on Continuous Integration we will learn how to use Github Actions so that these tests are automatically run when a PR is created, and have GitHub report the results.\nA software test consists of:\nWe will be using the python pytest library.\nIn order to understand how tests work in pytest we need to know a few programming concepts: functions, parameters, and exceptions.\nA function is a reuseable chunk of code. A function is defined by providing a name and then providing the chunk of code. We can then use the chunk of code by calling the name from other code.\nA parameter is an object that the function receives, it is usually a piece of data like a piece of text or a number.\nThe return value of a function is the output that is returned. When a function is called from other code, we can replace the function with its return value to help understand what will happen in the code.\nFor example, imagine we are working with phone numbers. We want to re-format phone numbers to make them readable. For example, if we were given 5125555678 we would want to reformat that to show (512) 555 5678\nThe variable phone_num_to_fix is the parameter, the function name is fix_phone_num, and the return value will be the contents of the variable fixed_num (which are the parts stiched back together).\nWe can manually test our function in a notebook using two cells. The first cell has the code above to define the function, and the second cell has code to run the function. We can then inspect what it returns.\nIf we run this code in a cell in a notebook, we will see the result is\nThe starting/ending single quote marks ('   ') are python’s way of telling us that this is a string.

An assertion is a statement that checks if a piece of code returns True or False. If assert sees True then the test has passed. If it sees False then the test has failed. We can use it to check whether our function (given a particular input) gives us our expected output.\nSo now we have our function above and one additional function (the test) which has an assert within it.\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_fix_phone_num():\n  assert fix_phone_num(\"5125558823\") == '(512) 555 8823'\nThe assert line here receives an equality test ==.

    "section": "21.4 Dealing with bad input",
    "text": "21.4 Dealing with bad input\nOne very common kind of bug is when the code can’t handle unexpected input. For example, what happens if our function hits input like 'mobile' (which is not a phone). This is very useful for coordination since future developers might not understand what we assumed would be passed to a function. So we can use tests to see if our function will behave in the appropriate way.\nIn programming we can indicate that we’ve received something we weren’t expecting and can’t handle is to raise an Error. This will enable us to communicate effectively with future programmers. When we define our own error we can better describe the issue, avoiding just letting code fail. If we don’t throw a specific error, Python will end up throwing an obscure exception somewhere deep down the stack, or returning invalid output (but blithely keep going).\nFor example, if we pass our function a phone number that is too short, what will currently happen? Run this in a cell in a notebook.\nshort_num = \"51\"\n\nfix_phone_num(\"51\")\nPython will return `‘(51)’. That is not a valid phone number. (If you are wondering why it doesn’t throw an error, I was too, apparently string slicing doesn’t throw errors, even when the index passed is too high).\nWhat should our function do if it encounters something that it can’t turn into a valid phone number? The answer is that it should raise an Error. And we should throw the most specific kind of Error. Here that is going to be a ValueError\nThis brings us to another idea in testing: we should write the test first, see that it fails, then write the code. This feels a little backwards, but the idea is that helps quality. The idea is called Test Driven Development\nHere we can test whether code raises an Error using the pytest.raises function which we can use to check that, given a known bad input, our function will give us a helpful error.\ndef test_fix_phone_num():\n  assert fix_phone_num(\"5125558823\") == '(512) 555 8823'\n  \n  # Now check that a too short string gives a ValueError\n  with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n    fix_phone_num(\"51\")\nNow if we run our test, we will see it fail:\n========================= test session starts =========================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.10, pytest-7.1.2, pluggy-1.0.0 -- /usr/bin/python3\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\nrootdir: /work/files/workspace/i320d-pytest-example\nplugins: dash-2.13.0, web3-5.31.0, anyio-3.6.1\ncollected 1 item                                                      \n\nmy_code.py::test_fix_phone_num FAILED                           [100%]\n\n============================== FAILURES ===============================\n_________________________ test_fix_phone_num __________________________\n\n    def test_fix_phone_num():\n      assert fix_phone_num(\"5125558823\") == '(512) 555 8823'\n    \n      # Now check that a too short string gives a ValueError\n      with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n&gt;       fix_phone_num(\"51\")\nE       Failed: DID NOT RAISE &lt;class 'ValueError'&gt;\n\nmy_code.py:18: Failed\n======================= short test summary info =======================\nFAILED my_code.py::test_fix_phone_num - Failed: DID NOT RAISE &lt;class...\n========================== 1 failed in 0.17s ==========================\nSo now we know what we need to do. This is called “sanity checking” inputs. We can add an if statement to know whether to raise an error.\ndef fix_phone_num(phone_num_to_fix):\n  # can only handle numbers that are exactly 10 digits long\n  if (len(phone_num_to_fix) != 10):\n    raise ValueError(\"Can only format numbers that are exactly 10 digits long\")\n  \n  ...\nNow instead of invalid output, we get an Error with a specific message and we get guidance of where the problem is. If we run that code manually in a notebook we see:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[30], line 3\n      1 short_num = \"51\"\n----&gt; 3 fix_phone_num(\"51\")\n\nCell In[29], line 4, in fix_phone_num(phone_num_to_fix)\n      1 def fix_phone_num(phone_num_to_fix):\n      2   # can only handle numbers that are exactly 10 digits long\n      3   if (len(phone_num_to_fix) != 10):\n----&gt; 4     raise ValueError(\"Can only format numbers that are exactly 10 digits long\")\n      6   # given \"5125558823\". Split the parts, then recombine and return\n      7   area_code = phone_num_to_fix[0:2] # 512 (first three digits)\n\nValueError: Can only format numbers that are exactly 10 digits long\nAnd if we run pytest on the commandline, we will see that the test passes (because calling with “51” does indeed throw the expected ValueError).\n$ pytest -v my_code_error.py \n============================ test session starts ============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.10, pytest-7.1.2, pluggy-1.0.0 -- /usr/bin/python3\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\nrootdir: /work/files/workspace/i320d-pytest-example\nplugins: dash-2.13.0, web3-5.31.0, anyio-3.6.1\ncollected 1 item                                                            \n\nmy_code_error.py::test_fix_phone_num PASSED                           [100%]\n\n============================= 1 passed in 0.05s =============================\nIf you are wondering why it only says “1 passed” that is because pytest only counts the number of functions (beginning with test_). It doesn’t count the number of assertions. If you’d prefer to see these two checks as different tests, then you have to create a new test_ method (e.g., test_value_error_on_wrong_length).",

    "text": "24 What is needed for package management?\nPackages are ways of distributing software. We discussed packages in the material on Stack, Streak and Ecosystem: Chapter 10\nPackages enable us to build on the work of others, when we install packages and import them into our code.\nBut eventually we will have code that we want to distribute to others, whether that be classmates or others within our organization, or perhaps the world at large.\nThere are a few ways that we can distribute code, all with pros and cons.\nCopy and paste. We can send code to others by simply copying and pasting, then sending perhaps by Slack or even through email. A slightly more advanced approach is to use a gist or pastebin such as https://gist.github.com/ or http://pastebin.com. Copy and pasting is quick but it is limited. We then have no way of updating the code, or of knowing where it is used.\nWe can, of course, share code via GitHub or GitLab. Here we can publish a repository, either publicly or within our Organization, and give people the URL. Then people can clone the code into their individual workspaces. At least then the potential user can re-visit for updates and our user would know where they could contact people for issues or even to share improvements.\nBut GitHub on its own does not offer much to manage the complexities of developing software and keeping things up to date over time. For that we must turn to packaging and to package distribution systems which provides the python packages that can be installed by pip. These offer much greater effectiveness: the package publisher can provide updates, bugfixes or improvements, and the user can get informed about when updates are available and have them automatically downloaded.\nPackages and package management offer a few other important advantages:\nPackaging can be thought about in four steps:\nDifferent languages and software ecosystems implement these steps themselves.\nIn Python, for examples, Encapsulation is done with directories, which have files inside with the code (“regular” some_code_name.py files. Metadata is done with additional files inside the directories. The tool pip handles both installation and dependency resolution. For the server that hosts the packages there is one broad public server called PyPI (which stands for the PYthon Package Index), but it is also possible for individual organizations to run a version “behind the firewall” to manage packages within their organization.\nIn R, encapsulation is also done thorugh directories, metadata through files. Package installation is done within the R base software. In R there are a few important central repositories, including CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) and Bioconductor (a separate package manager focused on biology packages, an example of convergent evolution). There are lots of different mirrors for CRAN.\nPackage management “behind the firewall” is so important to firms, that the company that builds Rstudio now offers package management for both R and Python https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/ both publically and within companies. Similarly Anaconda a company based in Austin offers package management across an eve wider set of languages.",

On windows you may need to use the right-click context menu for copy and paste in a terminal.\n\n\nA.1.5 git commit throws me into a weird mode\nIf you type git commit just on its own rather than git commit -m \"Some message\" you will see something like this:\n\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n#\n# On branch master\n# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\ngit needs a commit message. When you don’t provide one it throws you into a text editor, expecting you to type a small novel.\nThe editor that you go into by default is the vi or vim editor. It can be confusing because it has multiple modes (ie typing doesn’t always just produce text).\nThe best option is to:\n\nHit esc twice: Esc Esc\n\nType :q! and hit Enter\nRedo your commit using `git commit -m “Some message”\n\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim\nThe option below does not work in Rstudio because Rstudio captures the Ctrl key commands\nYou can also configure git to use another editor: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2596805/how-do-i-make-git-use-the-editor-of-my-choice-for-editing-commit-messages\nFor example, the nano editor is easier to use. You can set that run running\ngit config --global core.editor \"nano\"\nIn nano we can type a commit message as usual. The bottom of the screen shows commands. Nano uses the ^ symbol to represent the Ctrl key. We have to save the file and then exit Nano. So to save the message and return to the commandline we use:\nCtrl + O\nThen:\nCtrl + X",

We can’t delete our home folder, because it has everything else inside it. We have to somehow tell the computer that the home folder should not be a git repo. Happily, then only thing that makes it a git repo is that it has a .git folder inside it. You can confirm by running:\nls -lah\nThe -a flag to ls makes it show all files and folders, even the hidden ones that start with a dot.\nTo fix this we could just delete the .git folder but we might lose data that way (if we had already added work to that repo). So safest thing is to make a new folder inside our home folder, and then move the .git there.\nmkdir backup_home_git\nmv ./.git ./backup_home_git\nNow you could cd backup_home_git and use that folder as a git repo. But probably you are about to clone from github (in which case a new folder will be created) or you are about to use git init to create a new local repo (in which case you should create a folder first, cd into it, then run git init.",

Sometimes this is called “previewing the PR”. It is useful when working with PRs from others, and can also be useful when working on our own branches, but where we don’t want to merge that branch to main (which is a difficult operation to undo).\nOn GitHub (and other online repositories like Gitlab or BitBucket) we can do this because the pull requests are added to the online repository, somewhat like branches. We can access these using the git fetch command pointing to the pull part of the repository.\ngit fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123\ngit checkout pr-123\nThis obtains the code as though the PR had been accepted and then makes a new local branch that we can work with. Notice, though, that thje new local branch is not the same branch that the PR is for … it is a local copy. Therefore we would not push that new local branch back up to GitHub, preferring to work with the PR itself (and here is documentation about how to allow others to edit your PRs).",
