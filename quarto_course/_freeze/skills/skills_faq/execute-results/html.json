These are distinct from your `github` account (remember `git` can be used independently of an online service or with online services other than github).\n\nIf you are seeing messages that end like this:\n\n```         \nYou can suppress this message by setting them explicitly. Run the\nfollowing command and follow the instructions in your editor to edit\nyour configuration file:\n\n    git config --global --edit\n\nAfter doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:\n\n    git commit --amend --reset-author\n```\n\nThen you can run these commands to set a username and email. Note that these can be anything, they aren't a login or checked against anything, they are just metadata attached to your commits. Nonetheless having them make sense for your identity makes sense when sharing code publically. They can easily be a made up identifier (pseudonym/handle/accountname).\n\n``` bash\ngit config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\ngit config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n```\n\n### Login to GitHub {#sec-github-login}\n\nOn the commandline we have to use the username/PAT combination. The password that works to log into GitHub on the web will not work.\n\nIf you see this message:\n\n```\nremote: No anonymous write access.\nfatal: Authentication failed for <repo_url>\n```\n\nThen you need to log in, but first reset the credential cache:\n\n```sh\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'\n```\n\nThen repeat the command that failed (hit the up-arrow twice usually brings it up).\n\nWhen you see this prompt, use your GitHub username (not the email address)\n\n```\nUsername for 'https://github.com': <your_github_username> \n```\n\nWhen you see this prompt, even though it says \"password\" you must use your PAT token:\n\n```\nPassword for 'https://<your_github_username>@github.com': \n```\n\nOn windows you may have to use the right-click context menu to paste into the terminal.\n\n### Password pop-up repeats too often {#sec-pass-popup}\n\nThe username/password pop-up can come up too often. Especially with GitHub requiring a PAT (and not the same password used on the website) this can be a hassle, since the PAT is not configurable and has to be copy/pasted.\n\nRstudio is generating that pop-up, but the frequency is controlled by a gitconfig variable. The default without configuration is 15m so if we don't run a git command for 15m it expires the cache and pops up again. We can make it show up less with:\n\n``` sh\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'\n```\n\nThat means that the cache won't expire for 10,000,000 seconds (which is 16 weeks).\n\nThanks to <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#store-credentials-through-organic-git-use> and the Rstudio community forums for helping me with that <https://community.rstudio.com/t/git-user-pass-pop-ups-when-using-git-in-terminal-window/161213>\n\n### Shortcut to find GitHub URL {#sec-find-github-url}\n\nA short cut to find the URL is `git remote -v`\n\n```sh\n~/workspace/i320d-testing2024$ git remote -v\norigin  https://github.com/jameshowison/i320d-testing2024.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/jameshowison/i320d-testing2024.git (push)\n```\n\nAnd then copy the URL (with or without the .git at the end).  On windows you may need to use the right-click context menu for copy and paste in a terminal.\n\n### git commit throws me into a weird mode {#sec-vim}\n\nIf you type `git commit` just on its own rather than `git commit -m \"Some message\"` you will see something like this:\n\n``` bash\n\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n#\n# On branch master\n# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\n```\n\ngit needs a commit message. When you don't provide one it throws you into a text editor, expecting you to type a small novel.\n\nThe editor that you go into by default is the `vi` or `vim` editor. It can be confusing because it has multiple modes (ie typing doesn't always just produce text).\n\nThe best option is to:\n\n1.  Hit `esc` twice: <kbd>Esc</kbd> <kbd>Esc</kbd>\\\n2.  Type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>\n3.  Redo your commit using \\`git commit -m \"Some message\"\n\nSee <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim>\n\n**The option below does not work in Rstudio because Rstudio captures the** <kdb>Ctrl</kdb> key commands\n\nYou can also configure git to use another editor: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2596805/how-do-i-make-git-use-the-editor-of-my-choice-for-editing-commit-messages>\n\nFor example, the `nano` editor is easier to use. You can set that run running\n\n``` bash\ngit config --global core.editor \"nano\"\n```\n\nIn `nano` we can type a commit message as usual. The bottom of the screen shows commands. Nano uses the `^` symbol to represent the <kdb>Ctrl</kbd> key. We have to save the file and then exit Nano. So to save the message and return to the commandline we use:\n\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>\n\nThen:\n\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>\n\n## I accidentally made my home folder a git repo {#sec-faq-home-git-folder}\n\nIf you are in your home folder but `git status` doesn't give a \"fatal error\" then you've accidentially made your home folder into a git repository (probably by running `git init` in that folder).\n\nIn this case we need to undo this. We can't delete our home folder, because it has everything else inside it. We have to somehow tell the computer that the home folder should not be a git repo. Happily, then only thing that makes it a git repo is that it has a `.git` folder inside it. You can confirm by running:\n\n``` sh\nls -lah\n```\n\nThe `-a` flag to `ls` makes it show all files and folders, even the hidden ones that start with a dot.\n\nTo fix this we could just delete the `.git` folder but we might lose data that way (if we had already added work to that repo). So safest thing is to make a new folder inside our home folder, and then move the `.git` there.\n\n``` sh\nmkdir backup_home_git\nmv ./.git ./backup_home_git\n```\n\nNow you could `cd backup_home_git` and use that folder as a git repo. But probably you are about to clone from github (in which case a new folder will be created) or you are about to use `git init` to create a new local repo (in which case you should create a folder first, `cd` into it, then run `git init`.\n\n## Vizualizing git trees (aka gitviz) {#sec-gitviz}\n\nIn this course we are using a command that I usually call \"gitviz\" for short:\n\n``` sh\ngit log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n```\n\nThis produces reasonably readable graphs (especially for the teaching repos used in this course).\n\nThey look like this:\n\n``` bash\njlh5498@educcomp04:~/github_repos/i320_test3,,\\n git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n*   d8ab2c1 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Merge pull request #1 from jameshowison/new-feature\n|\\  \n| * ffb601d (origin/new-feature, new-feature) added extra\n|/  \n* f256ee7 Added line to README\n* 093fb0c Initial commit\n```\n\nOr as an image (with coloring as on Edupod Rstudio):\n\n![Image showing output of gitviz command shown as text above](images/gitviz_example.png)\n\nYou can read a little more about how to read these graphs here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22313343/git-graph-what-do-the-lines-and-asteriks-denote>\n\nLong story short:\n\n-   The asterisk characters (`*`) show a single commit\n-   The lines formed with characters like (`| \\ /`) help us follow which branches a commit was on.\n-   The words in parens show branch names, and can include the names of remotes (e.g., `origin/new-feature` means the `new-feature` branch on the `origin` remote)\n\nIt is a long command, so you can either keep it handy in a pastebin (I use Typinator) or you can register it as a command alias for git itself:\n\n``` sh\ngit config --global alias.viz 'log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color'\n```\n\nSo then you can just type:\n\n``` sh\ngit viz\n```\n\n## Seeing a merge conflict using git log\n\nIn one assignment students have to submit a repo showing a resolved merge conflict when accepting a PR. This raised the question of whether I could see this looking at the repo. Student questions helped me figure that our, leading me to <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15277708/how-do-you-see-show-a-git-merge-conflict-resolution-that-was-done-given-a-mer> which highlighted this as an issue in presenting merge conflicts for review. The most recent answer, led me to discover a new feature in `git`\n\n``` sh\ngit log --remerge-diff\n```\n\nThis enables one to see the files with the `<<<<<<` type conflict markers shown.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nrm -rf merge-conflict-example\ngit clone https://github.com/jameshowison/merge-conflict-example.git\ncd merge-conflict-example\ngit log -1 --skip 1 --remerge-diff\n## Cloning into 'merge-conflict-example'...\n## commit 50911dc2232965238790ad8ca3fdcabe56b41639\n## Merge: 57c1c6c 99b328f\n## Author: pablo-carbajo1 <99198265+pablo-carbajo1@users.noreply.github.com>\n## Date:   Thu Mar 2 18:06:57 2023 -0600\n## \n##     Merge branch 'main' into patch-1\n## \n## diff --git a/animals.txt b/animals.txt\n## remerge CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in animals.txt\n## index f9970b6..f07b36e 100644\n## --- a/animals.txt\n## +++ b/animals.txt\n## @@ -1,8 +1,5 @@\n## -<<<<<<< 57c1c6c (Update animals.txt)\n##  lion Contributor B\n## -=======\n##  lion contributor A\n## ->>>>>>> 99b328f (Merge pull request #4 from lisahyuniko/patch-1)\n##  tiger \n##  leopard \n##  turtle\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Gathering the code as though the PR had been accepted {#sec-fetch-pr}\n\nSometimes it is useful to be able to work with the code that would result if the PR was accepted, but without actually accepting the PR. Sometimes this is called \"previewing the PR\". It is useful when working with PRs from others, and can also be useful when working on our own branches, but where we don't want to merge that branch to main (which is a difficult operation to undo).\n\nOn GitHub (and other online repositories like Gitlab or BitBucket) we can do this because the pull requests are added to the online repository, somewhat like branches. [We can access these](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally) using the git `fetch` command pointing to the `pull` part of the repository.\n\n```sh\ngit fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123\ngit checkout pr-123\n```\n\nThis obtains the code **as though the PR had been accepted** and then makes a new _local branch_ that we can work with. Notice, though, that thje new local branch is not the same branch that the PR is for ... it is a local copy. Therefore we would not push that new local branch back up to GitHub, preferring to work with the PR itself (and [here is documentation about how to allow others to edit your PRs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)). \n\n\n# How to add an image using quarto on edupod\n\nQuarto is like html in that the main `.qmd` document references separate image files, rather than incorporates them inside the main file itself.  You have to place the images separetely (and also `git add` the image files separately).\n\nOn Edupod getting figures into your quarto document takes two steps:\n\n1. Upload the file to the server\n\n![](images/upload_file_to_edupod.png)\n\n2. Use the Visual mode in the quarto file editor to insert the picture.\n\n![](images/insert_image_to_qmd.png)\n\nUsing the Render button will confirm that your images are found.\n\nThen don't forget to `git add` the image files as well.  Run a `git status` to check which files are included.\n\n\n\n<!-- # Why does ggplot require less tidy data for multiline graphs?

This is possible because both variables are expressed in the same terms (both are degrees), so only a single scale is needed. Nonetheless, this is actually tricky to do in this wider tidier format.
