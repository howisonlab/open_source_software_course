## git issues

### Set my name and email

git wants to add your name and email to commits. These are distinct from your `github` account (remember `git` can be used independently of an online service or with online services other than github).

If you are seeing messages that end like this:

```         
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly. Run the
following command and follow the instructions in your editor to edit
your configuration file:

    git config --global --edit

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author
```

Then you can run these commands to set a username and email. Note that these can be anything, they aren't a login or checked against anything, they are just metadata attached to your commits. Nonetheless having them make sense for your identity makes sense when sharing code publically. They can easily be a made up identifier (pseudonym/handle/accountname).

``` bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

### Login to GitHub {#sec-github-login}

On the commandline we have to use the username/PAT combination. The password that works to log into GitHub on the web will not work.

If you see this message:

```
remote: No anonymous write access.
fatal: Authentication failed for <repo_url>
```

Then you need to log in, but first reset the credential cache:

```sh
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

Then repeat the command that failed (hit the up-arrow twice usually brings it up).

When you see this prompt, use your GitHub username (not the email address)

```
Username for 'https://github.com': <your_github_username> 
```

When you see this prompt, even though it says "password" you must use your PAT token:

```
Password for 'https://<your_github_username>@github.com': 
```

### Password pop-up repeats too often {#sec-pass-popup}

The username/password pop-up can come up too often. Especially with GitHub requiring a PAT (and not the same password used on the website) this can be a hassle, since the PAT is not configurable and has to be copy/pasted.

Rstudio is generating that pop-up, but the frequency is controlled by a gitconfig variable. The default without configuration is 15m so if we don't run a git command for 15m it expires the cache and pops up again. We can make it show up less with:

``` sh
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

That means that the cache won't expire for 10,000,000 seconds (which is 16 weeks).

Thanks to <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#store-credentials-through-organic-git-use> and the Rstudio community forums for helping me with that <https://community.rstudio.com/t/git-user-pass-pop-ups-when-using-git-in-terminal-window/161213>

### git commit throws me into a weird mode {#sec-vim}

If you type `git commit` just on its own rather than `git commit -m "Some message"` you will see something like this:

``` bash

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
```

git needs a commit message. When you don't provide one it throws you into a text editor, expecting you to type a small novel.

The editor that you go into by default is the `vi` or `vim` editor. It can be confusing because it has multiple modes (ie typing doesn't always just produce text).

The best option is to:

1.  Hit `esc` twice: <kbd>Esc</kbd> <kbd>Esc</kbd>\
2.  Type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
3.  Redo your commit using \`git commit -m "Some message"

See <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim>

**The option below does not work in Rstudio because Rstudio captures the** <kdb>Ctrl</kdb> key commands

You can also configure git to use another editor: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2596805/how-do-i-make-git-use-the-editor-of-my-choice-for-editing-commit-messages>

For example, the `nano` editor is easier to use. You can set that run running

``` bash
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

In `nano` we can type a commit message as usual. The bottom of the screen shows commands. Nano uses the `^` symbol to represent the <kdb>Ctrl</kbd> key. We have to save the file and then exit Nano. So to save the message and return to the commandline we use:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>

Then:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>

## I accidentally made my home folder a git repo {#sec-faq-home-git-folder}

If you are in your home folder but `git status` doesn't give a "fatal error" then you've accidentially made your home folder into a git repository (probably by running `git init` in that folder).

In this case we need to undo this. We can't delete our home folder, because it has everything else inside it. We have to somehow tell the computer that the home folder should not be a git repo. Happily, then only thing that makes it a git repo is that it has a `.git` folder inside it. You can confirm by running:

``` sh
ls -lah
```

The `-a` flag to `ls` makes it show all files and folders, even the hidden ones that start with a dot.

To fix this we could just delete the `.git` folder but we might lose data that way (if we had already added work to that repo). So safest thing is to make a new folder inside our home folder, and then move the `.git` there.

``` sh
mkdir backup_home_git
mv ./.git ./backup_home_git
```

Now you could `cd backup_home_git` and use that folder as a git repo. But probably you are about to clone from github (in which case a new folder will be created) or you are about to use `git init` to create a new local repo (in which case you should create a folder first, `cd` into it, then run `git init`.

## Vizualizing git trees (aka gitviz) {#sec-gitviz}

In this course we are using a command that I usually call "gitviz" for short:

``` sh
git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
```

This produces reasonably readable graphs (especially for the teaching repos used in this course).

They look like this:

``` bash
jlh5498@educcomp04:~/github_repos/i320_test3,,\n git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
*   d8ab2c1 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Merge pull request #1 from jameshowison/new-feature
|\  
| * ffb601d (origin/new-feature, new-feature) added extra
|/  
* f256ee7 Added line to README
* 093fb0c Initial commit
```

Or as an image (with coloring as on Edupod Rstudio):

![Image showing output of gitviz command shown as text above](images/gitviz_example.png)

You can read a little more about how to read these graphs here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22313343/git-graph-what-do-the-lines-and-asteriks-denote>

Long story short:

-   The asterisk characters (`*`) show a single commit
-   The lines formed with characters like (`| \ /`) help us follow which branches a commit was on.
-   The words in parens show branch names, and can include the names of remotes (e.g., `origin/new-feature` means the `new-feature` branch on the `origin` remote)

It is a long command, so you can either keep it handy in a pastebin (I use Typinator) or you can register it as a command alias for git itself:

``` sh
git config --global alias.viz 'log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color'
```

So then you can just type:

``` sh
git viz
```

## Seeing a merge conflict using git log

In one assignment students have to submit a repo showing a resolved merge conflict when accepting a PR. This raised the question of whether I could see this looking at the repo. Student questions helped me figure that our, leading me to <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15277708/how-do-you-see-show-a-git-merge-conflict-resolution-that-was-done-given-a-mer> which highlighted this as an issue in presenting merge conflicts for review. The most recent answer, led me to discover a new feature in `git`

``` sh
git log --remerge-diff
```

This enables one to see the files with the `<<<<<<` type conflict markers shown.

```{sh}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| collapse: true
rm -rf merge-conflict-example
git clone https://github.com/jameshowison/merge-conflict-example.git
cd merge-conflict-example
git log -1 --skip 1 --remerge-diff
```

```{bash}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
rm -rf merge-conflict-example
```

# How to add an image using quarto on edupod

Quarto is like html in that the main `.qmd` document references separate image files, rather than incorporates them inside the main file itself.  You have to place the images separetely (and also `git add` the image files separately).

On Edupod getting figures into your quarto document takes two steps:

1. Upload the file to the server

![](images/upload_file_to_edupod.png)

2. Use the Visual mode in the quarto file editor to insert the picture.

![](images/insert_image_to_qmd.png)

Using the Render button will confirm that your images are found.

Then don't forget to `git add` the image files as well.  Run a `git status` to check which files are included.




<!-- # Why does ggplot require less tidy data for multiline graphs? (aka longer less tidy) -->

<!-- tl;dr: when using a `group` like aes (`group` itself or `color`) you often need to transform data from a wider (but tidy) format into a longer (and arguably less tidy) format. -->

<!-- In the Tidy Data paper Wickham shows an example of tidying data from a longer format to a wider format. In the example he creates two new columns `tmax` and `tmin`. He argues that this wider format is tidier because each row contains an observation with two measured variables (tmax and tmin). -->

<!-- ![Table 12 from Wickham's Tidy Data paper](images/tidydata_table12_tmax_tmin.png){fig-alt="Tables showing a longer form on the left (a type column called 'element' with the values tmax and tmin), and a wider form on the right (separate columns titled tmax and tmin)"} -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table12_df_wider <- tribble( -->

<!--   ~id, ~date, ~element, ~value, -->

<!--   #--------------------------- -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-01-30, "tmax", 27.8, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-01-30, "tmin", 14.5, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-02, "tmax", 27.3, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-02, "tmin", 14.4, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-03, "tmax", 24.1, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-03, "tmin", 14.4, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-11, "tmax", 29.7, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-11, "tmin", 13.4, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-23, "tmax", 29.9, -->

<!--   "MX17004", 2010-02-23, "tmin", 10.7 -->

<!-- ) -->

<!-- table12_tidy <- table12_df_wider %>%  -->

<!--   pivot_wider(names_from = element, values_from = value) -->

<!-- table12_tidy -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Yet it is common to want to graph both of these variables as a multi-line graph. This is possible because both variables are expressed in the same terms (both are degrees), so only a single scale is needed. Nonetheless, this is actually tricky to do in this wider tidier format. Because it requires two column names, which must be hard coded. We also can't easily get a legend. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table12_tidy %>%  -->

<!--   ggplot(aes(x = date)) + -->

<!--   geom_line(aes(y = tmin), color = "green") + -->

<!--   geom_line(aes(y = tmax), color = "blue") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Another approach enables us to get as many lines as there are, and get automatic colors and legends. This uses the `group` aesthetic. But to do this we need all the column names in a single column as strings. This changes our data back into the longer format. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table12_longer_again <- table12_tidy %>%  -->

<!--   pivot_longer(cols = c(tmax, tmin), names_to = "measure", values_to = "temperature") -->

<!-- table12_longer_again -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This is identical to where we started, with Table 12a (other than changed column names!). Yet this can be much more easily graphed, giving much easier access and automatic scales (and thus legends). -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table12_longer_again %>%  -->

<!--   ggplot(aes(x = date, y = temperature, color = measure)) +  -->

<!--   geom_line() -->

<!-- ``` -->
