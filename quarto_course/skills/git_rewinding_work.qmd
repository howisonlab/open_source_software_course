# Rewinding work {#sec-rewinding}

## Prep exercise.

Revisit the material from last week at @sec-git_basic_workflow.

Your task is to create a git repository that when you run our `git viz` command, your screen shows this result (the commit hash abbreviations, like `1b2162e` will vary on your repo)

``` bash
test-rewind % git viz                         
* 50590c5 (HEAD -> main) made third edit
* 39f89db made second edit
* 1b2162e made first edit
```

If `git viz` is not working yet in your git install, revisit @sec-gitlog

## Hint 1: Getting started

You will need to start by making a directory called `test-rewind` then using `cd test-rewind` to change into it, and using `git init` to establish a git repo.

## Hint 2: Files and commit messages

Then create a file (like `README`), make edits, and use `git add` and `git commit -m "made first edit"` to create your first commit. Repeat this process for the second and third commits.

## Why rewind?

![Committing before experimenting](https://i.imgflip.com/aij747.jpg){fig-alt="Skyrim meme showing player character saving the game with text 'Me making a git commit' above and 'before trying something that will probably break everything' below"}

When we are working we often want to try things out before we are 100% sure that they will work. We want to be able to experiment and find our way through a problem. If our experiment doesn't work, we want to be able to step backwards in time, to find an earlier version that is a good new starting point.

In many ways this is identical to the idea of a "save point" in a game. We can step backwards in time and try again. We can reload that point at any time in the future. In our paper plane analogy, we can reach out and grab any tray in our repository.

Git enables us to save full copies of our working directory. We can then get back to the state of our work at any time we made a commit. When we check out a historical state, we get the files and the folders as as they were. So git actually swaps out the directory.

When I first started using git, I found this a bit confusing. usually when one restores from a backup, it is more like downloading a file. One gets to choose:

-   what to call the newly obtained older version
-   where to put it
-   what to do if there is a file that would be over-written.

What git does, though, is it swaps out all the files and folders with the previous version.

![Git commits are just snapshots](https://i.imgflip.com/aij69z.jpg){fig-alt="Astronaut meme showing two astronauts in space. First astronaut looking at Earth says 'Wait, it's all just snapshots?' Second astronaut pointing gun says 'Always has been.'"}

As we've seen, though, git is more fine-grained than a video game save-point. We often have files that have changed that we don't want included in our save-point, this is why we have the `git add` stage before `git commit`.

Thus we can have `untracked` files or folders hanging around in our working folder. Git won't change these when we do a checkout. So what happens is:

1.  git checks that all tracked files are in a "clean" state. This means that they are unchanged from the last commit. This is git checking that you have "saved your work" before it swaps out the files.
2.  git goes to its repository, locates the commit you ask for, and swaps all the tracked files and folders in the working directory.
3.  git remembers what commit you've moved to, so that if you make edits you can decide how they should be applied into the stream of commits in your repository.

To move backwards in time we use the `git checkout` command. We have to let git know which commit we want to go back to. We can specify that using the name that git uses, which is the hash (e.g., `1b2162e`) shown by git log.

Starting with our 3 commit test-rewind repo:

``` bash
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git viz
* 50590c5 (HEAD -> main) made third edit
* 39f89db made second edit
* 1b2162e made first edit
```

We can move to the first commit using

``` bash
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git checkout 1b2162e
```

which produces the output

``` bash
Note: switching to '1b2162e'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 1b2162e made first edit
```

If we run our viz command we can see a little more:

``` bash
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git viz
* 50590c5 (main) made third edit
* 39f89db made second edit
* 1b2162e (HEAD) made first edit
```

See how the word `HEAD` now appears on the bottom line and not the top line? This is git's way of telling us what is checked out.

When git says `detached HEAD` (a little intense sounding) git is highlight for us that our current working directory is not at the last commit. This means that if we try to make a new `commit` git wants us to know that it won't just pop onto the top of the repo like usual.

For now, though, we can inspect files back at this version, and we can shift to another version (using `checkout`). For example we can move back to our top commit, using `git checkout main`.

If you see a `error: pathspec 'main' did not match any file(s) known to git` use `git checkout master` (newer git installs use `main` and older installs use `master`).

``` bash
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git checkout main
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git viz
* 50590c5 (HEAD -> main) made third edit
* 39f89db made second edit
* 1b2162e made first edit
```

Notice how `HEAD` now points to the top commit? If we `edit/add/commit` our commits will drop back on top.

``` bash
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git add README 
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git commit -m "Made fourth edit"
[main ff7997b] Made fourth edit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
jlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git viz
* ff7997b (HEAD -> main) Made fourth edit
* 50590c5 made third edit
* 39f89db made second edit
* 1b2162e made first edit
```

While we can always use the hash abbreviations like `50590c5` as names for commits, there is also a relative syntax.

`git checkout HEAD~1`

will get the commit one back from where `HEAD` is currently pointing. `HEAD~2` will be 2 back, and so on. `HEAD~` (without any number after the tilde) is a shortcut for `HEAD~1`

Remember, git swaps out all the **tracked** files when you do a `checkout`. Experiment to find out what happens to **untracked** files: - Create a file called `my-untracked-file` run `git status` - Run `git checkout <earlier-commit>` (where `<earlier-commit>` is a hash for your first commit) - Run `git status` again.

## Undo

Sometimes (well often, really) we need to undo things we've done in git. Unfortunately there isn't one `Ctrl-Z` type undo process in git. Here are three common scenarios with our `edit, save, add, commit` cycle.

### Undo edits to a file (before add or commit)

Before we use `git add` we are in a familiar world of files. When you save changes to disk you are over-writing what is there before. Just being inside a git repo doesn't change that.

Git can help us get back to how files were at our last commit, though, using

``` sh
git checkout -- <file>
```

Note the slightly weird `--` in the middle of this command, this is needed when addressing a specific file (without it git thinks we are referring to other things, usually the name of a commit).

Careful, though, this will over-write whatever changes you have made manually to that file. If we haven't done `git add` and `git commit` then that work would be lost.

Think of this as throwing everything out to get back to a known starting point.

### Undo adding files (before commit)

When we add a file, we are placing the file onto the tray, ready to copy into the repository. In git language we use `git add` we are "staging" a set of changes ready to commit. If we run `git status` we will see the files added under `Changes to be committed` (usually shown in green).

Sometimes we accidentally add files with changes that we don't want to include in the commit (e.g., because they are unrelated to the current set of changes and would just clutter the commit up for people trying to understand it)

Helpfully, the output of `git status` helps coach us how to fix this. We can use `git restore --staged <file>` This works with individual files, but `<file>` can also refer to a folder, in which case all the files inside that folder will be unstaged.

## Revert - commits to undo commits

Once we have made a commit we face a different problem. Git is like a "ledger" in accounting that provides an "audit trail": we can't just easily delete something from history. Instead we can make a commit that reverses the mistake. One analogy that I like is that if the mistaken commit is "matter" then the revert commit is "anti-matter", it exactly reverses all the changes of the mistaken commit. See <https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/>

To revert a commit, use:

``` sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Git will create a new commit that undoes all changes from the specified commit.

This does leave the history looking a bit messy. We will explore other opportunities to tidy things up later in the course. One note at this point: if things like passwords get into the git history, it can be very difficult to entirely eliminate them from the history (and one never knows if others have unchanged copies) so generally if passwords or other secrets (like API keys) get into a git repository then it's time to change the password or secret!

## Dealing with Git's default editor (vi/vim)

When you run `git commit` without the `-m` flag, Git opens a text editor for you to write your commit message. By default, this is often **vi** (or vim), which can be very confusing.

![](images/vi%20editor.png)

If you find yourself in vi, you might notice:\
- A screen with `~` symbols on the left\
- Typing doesn't work as expected\
- No obvious way to exit or save

**To escape from vi without saving:**\
1. Press `Esc` twice (to enter command mode)\
2. Type `:q!`\
3. Press `Enter`

This exits without making a commit.

### Switching to nano

Instead of struggling with vi, we recommend configuring **nano** as your default editor. Nano is much more user-friendly and works like most text editors you're familiar with.

**To configure nano as your default Git editor, run this command once:**

``` bash
git config --global core.editor nano
```

**Using nano:**

When Git opens nano for a commit message, you'll see:

![](images/nano%20editor.png)

\- Simply type your commit message at the top \
- The bottom shows available commands where \`\^\` means the \`Ctrl\` key

**\*\*To save and exit nano:\*\*** \
1. Press \`Ctrl + X\` (shown as \`\^X Exit\` at the bottom) \
2. Press \`Y\` when asked "Save modified buffer?" \
3. Press \`Enter\` to confirm
