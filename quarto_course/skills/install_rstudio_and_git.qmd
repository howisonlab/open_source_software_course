## Configure Nano as Default Git Editor

When you run `git commit` without the `-m` flag, Git opens a text editor
for you to write your commit message. By default, this is often **vi**
(or vim), which can be very confusing.

![](images/vi%20editor.png)

If you find yourself in vi, you might notice: \
- A screen with `~` symbols on the left \
- Typing doesn't work as expected \
- No obvious way to exit or save

**To escape from vi without saving:** \
1. Press `Esc` twice (to enter command mode) \
2. Type `:q!` \
3. Press `Enter`

This exits without making a commit.

**Switching to nano**

Instead of struggling with vi, we recommend configuring **nano** as your
default editor. Nano is much more user-friendly and works like most text
editors you're familiar with.

**To configure nano as your default Git editor, run this command once:**

``` bash
git config --global core.editor nano
```

**Using nano:**

When Git opens nano for a commit message, you'll see:

![](images/nano%20editor.png)

-   Simply type your commit message at the top
-   The bottom shows available commands where `^` means the `Ctrl` key

**To save and exit nano:** \
1. Press `Ctrl + X` (shown as `^X Exit` at the bottom) \
2. Press `Y` when asked "Save modified buffer?" \
3. Press `Enter` to confirm

## Git Default Branch: Main vs Master

Git's default branch name has changed over time. Depending on your Git version and when you set up your repository, you may see either main or master as your default branch name. These are functionally identical, just different names for the same thing.

### Check Your Default Branch

Check Your Git's Default Branch Setting
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch
```

### Standardizing to `main` (Recommended)

**Configure Git for future repositories**
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

This ensures all new repositories you create will use `main` by default.
