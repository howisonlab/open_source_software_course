# GitHub solo {#sec-github-solo}

Thus far your repositories have all been in your local filespace. This is often on a laptop, although for consistency this semester as we learn, we have been creating and using repos on DataCamp.

Even when working on one's own (solo), it can be convenient to have a backup in the cloud. Git hosting services provide this. Examples include Github, GitLab, and BitBucket. As we will see later, these services also provide a platform for collaborating with others, but they work just as well as a backup for solo work.

## Create a GitHub account

You will need to have a working [GitHub](https://github.com) account. You are welcome to use an existing Github account (if you happen to have one), or you can create one just for this course (a "throwaway") or you can use your real name and plan to retain this account for your professional life. Whichever you choose you will need a working email address associated with the account (to confirm and see the notifications).

## Create a repository on GitHub

Once you are logged into GitHub you can create a repository using the "New Repository" button (which is usually green colored).

You will need to give two things:

1.  A repository name. I suggest that you use a prefix of `i320d-` for all the repos used in this class. That will ensure you can easily clean them up later.

2.  Be sure to select "Add a README file" under the *Initialize this repository with ...* section.

Once you've created the repository you will see a "Quick Setup" page. This shows you the URL of the repository that you've created. This is how mine looks:

![](images/new_repo_url.png)

You should copy the URL using the little grey box-on-box on the right.

## Clone the repo to your local space

Now that we have an empty repo on Github, we can bring it down to our local space.  This uses a git command called `git clone`. 

Go to the Terminal on DataCamp.

Before running git clone, everyone needs to ensure they are in a folder that is not inside another repo. You can place repos anywhere you want. I suggest placing them all into your home folder on edupod. You can be sure you are there by running this command (read as "cd tilde" because tilde is a shortcut for your home directory).

```sh
cd ~
```

To be sure that you aren't inside another repo you can run `git status` and you *want* to see a fatal error.

``` sh
git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /stor/home)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
```

If you do not see the fatal error, then you need to move up in your folder hierarchy until you are not in a repo. Use `cd ..` or `cd ~`. If you still get that error and you are in your home folder, see FAQ for "I accidentally made my home folder a git repo" at @sec-faq-home-git-folder 

Then clone your repository and change directory into it.

For my example repo in the image above this would be:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jameshowison/i320d-test1.git
cd i320d-test1
```

You will need to replace the repo URL and the repository name to match yours.  The general form looks like this (but you replace the `<repo_url>` and `<repository_name>` placeholders.)

``` sh
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

## Edit/Save/Add/Commit as usual

Now we can do our usual git stuff: We can edit a file, save it, then use `git add` and `git commit -m "Some message"` to store our new version in git.

As usual, here is a command that simulates editing and saving a file (which you can also do through the RStudio interface):

```sh
echo -e "\n\nA new line in README" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added line to README"
```

Note that you may have to set the `user.email` and `user.name` fields.  These do not have to match up with your GitHub username and/or email.

```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Now we are ready to send data back up to GitHub.  While the repo is public readable, it is not public writeable.  If we try to send things up using the `git push` command we will see this error.

```
git push
remote: No anonymous write access.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/jameshowison/i320d-testing2024.git/'
```

Only people with special permission can add things to the repository. So we have to set up authentication. To clear anything out (and avoid being asked for these details a lot) we need to run:

```sh
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

## Obtain special password for commandline git (PAT)

Your password for GitHub will give you access to the GitHub web interface, but to connect `git` on the commandline to GitHub we need a *Personal Access Token* (PAT).  You can think of this as a special use password. Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> (You will need to be logged into GitHub).

1. Click "Generate token".  
2. Chose "Generate New Token (classic)" from the drop down (**not Fine-grained**)
3. Select "repo" "workflow" and "user" permissions and then hit "Generate Token"

You will then be able to copy the PAT.You need to keep this somewhere you can copy from in class. I put it into my password manager (I use 1password).  Note that this gives full access to your GitHub account, so if you have work stuff or other things in there, come talk to me or use a "fine-grained access token" scoped only to the repos for this class.

## Send your changes up to GitHub 

The `git push` command will move any new work from your local repo, up to GitHub. 

```sh
git push
```

git will ask for your username/password.  You should use your GitHub username, but the PAT when asked for the password. **Your regular GitHub password will not work**. You have to use the PAT you created in the previous step.  If you didn't copy it down, you can create a new one, don't forget to store it somewhere so that you can copy it for use in class.

By default you will have to re-enter this username/PAT any time you haven't run a `git push` command for 15 minutes.  More details in the FAQ on this in @sec-pass-popup but you can reduce pops by running:

## Go to GitHub to confirm

Now head to GitHub to confirm that your changes made it up to the server. You can use `git remote -v` as a shortcut to find the URL of the repo, if it isn't still open in your browser. See @sec-find-github-url for more.

## Working with branches locally and remotely

We can create branches locally, and then push them up to GitHub.

```sh
git branch test-new-branch
git checkout test-new-branch
echo "Change on new-branch" >> README.md 
git add README.md 
git commit -m "change on locally created branch"
```

Now we have a branch locally, but that branch is not in the repo on GitHub. This means we may see a message about needing to set an *upstream branch*. Something like this:

```bash
$ git push
fatal: The current branch test-branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin test-branch
```

You can copy that suggested command within terminal and run it.  This tells git to create your new branch on the origin remote.

You should see something like:

```
:~/workspace/i320d-testing2024$ git push --set-upstream origin test-new-branch

```

(Remember if you see a `fatal: Authentication failed` message follow instructions here: @sec-github-login)

## Find your branch on GitHub, create and merge Pull Request

On GitHub you can now find your branch.  You have to view your repo on GitHub (remember @sec-find-github-url for shortcut to find URL.)

Once you see your repo on GitHub, you can find your branch using the Branch drop-down.

![Image of drop down menu for branches, shows for-pull-request and master](images/selecting_branch_on_github.png)

Select that and you will see a "Compare & pull request button"

![Image of Compare and Pull Request Button](images/compare_and_pr.png)

When you click the green button you will see:

![Image showing New PR interface. A purple circle highlights the section discussed below](images/create_pr.png)

Notice the purple circle that shows `base: main <-- compare: new-feature`. Notice that the arrow points **right to left**. The destination of the PR comes first (here it is `main`) and the place we are merging from comes second (here it is `new-feature`).

The interface shows that the branches can be merged automatically. This means that the changes in the `new-feature` branch would not cause conflicts if merged into `main`.

You can go ahead and Create the PR.

This will lead to a PR page, where you could chat about the suggested changes.

![Image showing PR. A purple circle highlights the section discussed below](images/pr_ready_to_merge.png)

Notice the sentence in the purple circle: `jameshowison wants to merge 1 commit into main from new-feature` that is a useful succinct summary of what a PR is: it is a request to merge a set of commits from one branch into another.

If you hit the "Merge Pull Request" button GitHub will merge the branch to main, close the PR, and suggest that you delete the branch.

## Synchronize your local repo

All the PR steps have happened on GitHub only, so they aren't yet reflected in your local repo.  We have merged `new-feature` to `main` on GitHub.

At this point you need to synchronize by first switching to main:

```sh
git checkout main
```

and then get changes from the remote

```sh
git pull
```

You will see something like:

```
~/workspace/i320d-testing2024$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
```

```
~/workspace/i320d-testing2024$ git pull
Updating 441124e..8ba5e91
Fast-forward
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

and if you run

```sh
git status
```

you will see that everything is synchronized. (`origin/main` means the branch up on GitHub)

```
~/workspace/i320d-testing2024$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
