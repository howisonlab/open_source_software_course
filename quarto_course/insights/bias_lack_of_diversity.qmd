# Bias and Lack of Diversity {#sec-diversity}

Open source software production lacks diversity. In fact open source is even less diverse than the software industry in general.  Open source shares this perhaps surprising characteristic with other open collaborative projects, including Wikipedia.

In class today we will undertake shared note-taking in groups on this topic, preparing for a discussion.

Examine these "developer surveys" to add data (agreeing or disagreeing) with the opening statement of this page:

Questions for discussion:

1. What types of diversity does the literature discuss? How does open source compare to: a) the world, b) software industry as a whole.

2. What causes are discussed?

3. What possible approaches to improving the situation are discussed?  How might approaches used in Wikipedia help?

4. What authority of legitimacy does work to improve diversity draw on?

5. In what ways does a lack of diversity mean that open source is failing to live up to its own ideals?
